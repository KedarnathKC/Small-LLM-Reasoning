It 's difficult to answer the question `` what are you going to do in the future ? '' if the only one who has to know is undecided
When I was younger , I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a saleswoman , and even a butcher
I would like to study psychology because , one day , I would open my own psychology office and help people
It 's difficult because I 'll have to study hard and a lot , but I think that if you like a subject , you 'll study it more easily
Maybe I 'll change my mind , maybe not
I think that public transport will always be important in the future
The rich people will buy a car , but poor people always have to use a bus or taxi
I consider it to be more convenient to drive a car because you can carry more things in a car than when traveling by public transportation
Also , you 'll meet friendly people who usually ask you something and want to be friends with you and exchange telephone numbers
In my experience , when I did n't have a car , I used to use the bus to go to school and back home
In my opinion , the car is n't necessary when you crash in the street ; at that moment , you realize the importance of public transport
In India , we have various types of public transport , like cycles , bikes , cars , trains , and flights
Depending on the distance to the desired place and the duration of the trip , the mode of transport is chosen accordingly
Generally speaking , travelling by car is much more fun than other modes of transport
This reminds me of a trip that I recently visited , and the place is Agra
It takes around 6 hours by the national highway to travel from Delhi to Agra
We stopped at hotels to have food and also purchased some snacks before the trip , just in case any of us felt hungry
Since we have the option to wait anytime we want when we travel by car , which is impossible when traveling by train and flight
In addition to other comforts , we can also take a comfortable short nap on the back seat and wake up feeling refreshed
Due to the above-mentioned reasons , I conclude that travelling by car is much more convenient
My name is Sarah
I am 17 years old
I am looking forward to joining you in this year 's summer camps
I love children , and I enjoy looking after them
In addition to that , I enjoy cooking
My family think that my cooking is amazing
I hope that you give me the chance to join you
Thank you
My favourite sport is volleyball because I love playing with my friends
Volleyball is a sport played everywhere , when I travel to the beach I like playing with my sister in the sand and then we go to the sea
It is very funny
When I was young , I liked to play with the ball in the playground , and my friend and I would play volleyball using the soccer goals as a makeshift net
Dear Jo
How are you ? I am writing to offer you some advice on travelling and working in my country
On the one hand , in my country , there are a lot of places to travel
For example , Barcelona , Madrid , Sevilla , and Valencia
There are wonderful cities because there are a lot of things to visit ; for example , in Madrid , you can visit `` Puerta del Sol '' and `` Las Cibeles ''
I visit Madrid twice a year
Every summer , I visit Sevilla because I love this city , and I suggest you do the same
On the other hand , in my country , there are a few jobs because the economy is very bad
But if you want me to look for a job with you
My best friend is looking for someone responsible for looking after her sister
Her sister is 6 years old and you should look after her every weekend
You will be interested in this job ?
Thank you for your email , it was wonderful to hear from you
I 'm looking forward to seeing you !
Take care , Laura
Today , public transport still plays an important role in the transportation system , and it will continue to play a role in the future
Because public transport is a cost-effective and efficient way to allocate resources in a mass transport system
People also do not need to suffer high operating costs running their own cars
But there is a cheaper way to go to their destination , especially when it is far away from home
For example , I think it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane to travel to another country
Instead , it will be common to buy an air ticket and fly on a commercial plane
In my opinion , public transport in the future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people who do n't have enough money to pay for a car , even if they buy a used one
If we think about it , the car is better because we do n't need to wait , as we do when waiting for the bus or underground
When traveling by car , we can be alone , which can be good because we can listen to the music we like and we do n't need to be around unknown people
If I had to choose between car and bus , I think I would probably choose car because it is better for me to go by car than to go by bus
In my community , we are very interested in the environment and ecological issues
We have solar panels and a place to make compost in our last garden , where worms eat and degrade the school 's organic waste
In some strategic points of the building , we have special trashcans to separate garbage into organic , paper , cardboard , cans , and pet bottles
The manager of this entire project is Ms
All these initiatives have made us , over the years , a recognized ecological community
Good morning everyone , today I want to talk about my favorite sport
My favorite sport is football
I believe that it will delight us
By the way , my favorite football team is Manchester United ; they are brilliant , they have amazing football players , and they are awesome
Michael was a little kid when he had a dream : to be a superhero
After many years , he still dreams of becoming a superhero
He entered a university of medicine because he thinks that this profession is the most similar to being a superhero
After passing some years at the university , he met a girl named Kate and he fell in love with her , and she fell in love with him
Kate was criticizing the University of Fashion
Then , the two of them started dating
Michael and Kate were so happy , until one day Michael said to her that his dream was to be a superhero
When she said that , Michael started to cry and got mad , saying that she was lying and did n't have a heart
He got so mad that he asked her to get out of his apartment
The following day , she said sorry , and they were happy again
But when they get to Michael 's home , they fight again , and Michael gets a knife and kills her
He cried with blood all around him
Michael gets away from there !
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake
Public transportation is an important invention in human history , and it brings a number of benefits to our lives
For instance , we take the subway in order to avoid getting stuck in traffic
It is true that moving by car is more convenient than taking public transportation ; however , it would cause more damage to our lives and harm the environment
Therefore , we need to think more about our future , our offspring
Giving them a safe , clean and comfortable place to live
If there is no public transportation , traffic jams will be worse than before
In my country , Taipei , we always get stuck in traffic for about one hour in the morning
I can not imagine how long it would take me to get to school if there were no bus or MRT
Car is convenient for humans , but it brings damage to humans
For example , carbon dioxide is emitted by cars
It causes global warming , which threatens our environment and harms our daily life
We can see that there are lots of serious and frequent weather disasters that have happened over the decades , such as typhoons , hurricanes , wildfires , and mudslides
What other precautions are usually taken ?
The NG Office is notified by the photographer when the film has been shipped
If the film does n't arrive on time , it will be cancelled
Lost shipments have been found more easily when this process is started right away
`` The pleasure of traveling is great
People go , people come
Every day , many people travel abroad , but what 's the best way to travel internationally ?
The most important option to travel is , by far , the plane
But even when it 's true that it 's the fastest option , you must be very careful when you get off a plane
If you are looking for comfort and relaxation , obviously , you have to take a boat
There are a wide variety of things to do , which make the trip enjoyable
Although flying might seem convenient , the better option is to pick out a train
There is no comparison to watching the changes in the landscape through a window , enjoying the view , and the best part is , it 's the cheapest way to get away for a few days and take a break from your routine
Anyway , no matter where you go or how you get there
The pleasure of travelling is in travelling at all
Transportation is one of the most important things in life , so we have many kinds of transportation
In modern societies , there are lots of friends in our daily lives
A big project could not be finished without cooperation
Friends can communicate and share ideas , feelings , and funny things that happen around us
More importantly , parents give us life , nurture us , and teach us knowledge , skills , and abilities to navigate the world
In this case , the families played important roles in daily life
The reasons are as follows
First of all , we can learn many skills from parents according to their experience
For example , we could learn how to communicate with others in a friendly way , and we could also learn how to make a meal with our parents
Secondly , the families could offer you some advice on how to deal with the things that might cause trouble
If difficulties were reported to the families , they would come up with ideas and discuss with you how to solve the situation
All in all , in this case , the families are the most important friends in our lives should be revised to All in all , the families are the most important friends in our lives or In this case , the families are the most important friends in our lives , depending on the intended emphasis
Computer technology has advanced significantly in recent years , making old computers almost useless and increasing the difference between old and new computers with every new discovery
As we can notice , old and new computers are vastly different
Old computers were used to occupy one entire room
You can have a portable computer now , and take it with you to every place you visit
Old computers only allowed you to perform math tasks or play simple games with two colors , green and black
One of the greatest achievements of new computing is the internet , where you can connect to other computers , download files or data , and access various online resources via Ethernet cable or Wi-Fi
`` Get defeated , mate ''
I went to the abandoned house and started to think about the best way to make someone 's life miserable
As I did n't find anything , I went to the place where he lives and started to look for some information about his life
But wait a minute , am I really so angry to make this ?
Yes !
I screamed
But I was so mad at him and so anxious to make his life impossible , and soon my fear of death and my anger for all of the suffering I had been through became stronger and bigger
I 'm not completely in agreement with this idea , or more simply , I do n't completely agree with this idea
On the one hand , traveling by car is really much more convenient as it gives you the chance to be independent
On the other hand , huge traffic jams are a big issue for travelling by car
My favorite sport is soccer
I was born to be a football player
For me , football is everything in my life
When I see football on the television , I dream of playing in a big team and in a big championship like the Barclays Premier League , Ligue 1 , or La Liga
My favourite clubs are Benfica and Real Madrid
I play football in a Portuguese club called Valenciano , and we have won a lot of games this season
I dream of winning many leagues in football and the best championship , which is the UEFA Champions League
I play football because I like playing it , but the only reason I do it is because of my dad
His dream is that I become the next captain of a big team , and win a lot of money
My name is Jonny
I graduated from National Taiwan University of Science and Technology
I am 25 years old

I planned many interesting activities for viewers to keep the competition alive
They enjoyed the game
I also like to cook

Public transportation has been used more by people , and over the years , it has become cheaper and safer
About 40 years ago , there was no such thing as public transportation , and people rarely owned cars , so during those years , there were n't even good facilities to move from one place to another
Nowadays , all modes of travel are more convenient , from cars to buses , even trains and planes
In summary , it is different from someone 's opinion to another
The topic itself explains the uncertainty of public transport in our country
This conclusion becomes more prominent if we look at the data on car companies and their exponential growth in sales figures , with the introduction of low-budget private cars
Development of the biodiesel industry can be a contribution to productivity growth
A large-scale investment was brought for biofuel development
Meanwhile , it boosts economic growth and job opportunities , thereby enhancing Gross Domestic Product ( GDP )
If you are living in a big town or a small one , it does not matter , but one thing that should be taken care of by the people and organizers of the town is the environment
Global warming is a huge issue today
The government should take immense action to stop it or , at the very least , slow its pace
However , we , the people , play a really important part in making it worse
An active and good government understands the value of taking care of trees , water , air , and much more to provide a fresh , clean , and safe environment for its people
Recycling items can be a good step towards a clean and safe environment , which is perfectly and promptly taken care of by my city
Everyone has to plant a tree in front of his or her home according to the rule of the provincial government
People do not realize that cutting trees can reduce the production of oxygen in the atmosphere
Eventually , humans will have no more fresh air to breathe
Additionally , our city government has prohibited smoking in public areas and to those under 18 years old , and provides free sessions of talks or presentations to increase awareness of a clean , safe , and fresh environment to the city
In conclusion , I would suggest that our neighboring cities take part in cleaning the environment , so that one day it can be seen across the country
Everybody has their favourite sport
My favourite sport is football
At our school or village football stadium , I spend a lot of time every day
Usually I play football with my classmates
Before training , I ran 1 to 2 kilometers and my legs gain power and my body gets energy
Our team has a hard-working coach who gives us professional advice on how to improve our football skills
He said , `` You must work and work very hard if you want to achieve high results ''
I can say that the coach is an experienced person
Not so long ago , we had competition
We got the first place
We have achieved this result because we are friendly and organized
I believe that in the future I will be a famous football player in teams such as Shakhtar or Dynamo
Football is my life !
I want to give advice to someone who starts this sport : `` You must believe in yourself ''
Hello my friend
What 's up ?
How are you ?
How was your day today ?
It 's really nice of you to have sent your email yesterday
You regret not being there with me
Dear Paul
I have seen your notice in the academy newspaper and I 'm quite interested
Having been born in the UK , I can therefore be a very good English teacher
Although I came to Spain ten years later , I can now speak with them in Spanish if it is necessary
Also , I attended a ballet course for 4 years when I was young
It was a long time ago , however , I still keep the rhythm in my body !
By the way , I remember I had to create a dynamic training to do with the other ballet course members
All members congratulated me as well
`` On the other hand , I took care of my brothers and cousins for many hours when they were very young
You must know that I 'm a very responsible , kind and funny person
That makes me a good candidate to get the job , which is also a hobby for me !
I hope you will consider my candidature , as I am committed to meeting your expectations and contributing positively
Best wishes , Julia
In my opinion , public transport wo n't suffer from the shortage of demand
Because not everyone can afford to buy their own car
Besides , there are lots of low-income people who ca n't buy their own car
So I think public transport 's future is bright
What is the meaning of `` Family '' ?
In my opinion , family is the place where you have your best friends and they can help and know each other
In Taiwan , many people have to take care of their parents when they get old , but the point is , what if you can not survive , I mean you do n't have enough money to raise your parents
Back to the topic , I do n't know any members of my family well , and I do n't trust them , honestly
I like New Zealand because there are many islands
By the way , New Zealand has cool weather
In Malaysia , the weather is slightly warmer than here
That 's why I recommend that all of you go there , experience the pleasure , and try their food
You can also buy a lot of gifts , such as key chains , statues , or other memories to make before returning to Malaysia
I did not have to go to New Zealand , but believe me , it is a very beautiful place
If I have food , I will go there and bring some back for all of you
I live in Lentini , a small city in east Sicily
The local Council has n't got a project for the environment
People collect any kind of rubbish and throw everything into a black sack
Although the Council began to plan something , the people are not committed to the problem
Around the city , you can find many places where people throw away refrigerators , kitchen appliances , asbestos , old appliances , or household items
What a pity !
The suburbs of Lentini could be wonderful
There are orange trees , a large lake and Etna in the background
When I was a child , I had a lot of friends and they were very important to me
We used to play in the park , where we would talk about our tastes - music and boys - and we laughed a lot
But when I was a teenager , I began to experience situations that I did not like , for instance , the girls said bad things to me or they talked badly about me
During those years , I experienced the worst moments of my life
I remember when I celebrated my 15th birthday , only one schoolmate wanted to come to my party
That night I cried because I felt that I did not have any friends
However , my parents tried to make my party the best
In this moment , I thought that my best friends were my parents and sister
I knew that they never talk badly about me
Now my husband is my best friend
He is the most important person of my life
He has always been with me
Also , he is very funny , and I laugh a lot with him
They both like to travel around the world and to practice sports , for example , tennis , running , or trekking
We like watching TV series , and cooking several desserts too
To sum up , my best friends are my family , especially my husband , David
The lives of people around the globe are becoming busier and busier day by day
A busy life always compels us to use the fastest and most convenient mode of transportation , which has led to public transportation systems falling behind motor cars

I am interested in this work because I enjoy travelling , and I am a teacher , so I also like working with children
I am sure that I will look after the children very well

On the other hand , I could teach Spanish to the children in the summer camps
I am waiting for your answer

The technology has changed people 's lives
Although personal vehicles , such as cars , are now popular , the role of public transportation is still very crucial in the years to come
Nowadays , people use fossil fuel as the most important source of energy for activities such as travelling and manufacturing
People must find ways to use other energy sources , such as nuclear power , wind power , and public transportation , such as electric metro , that use these kinds of energy
As a result , governments will invest more in researching the use of these new types of energy
The range of public services will be expanded to remote areas , which will make it much more convenient
Commuting and travelling using public transportation services will be the first choice
The population is increasing rapidly
In some perspectives , these problems are caused by the overuse of personal vehicles
People will realise that using their own car is a waste of time due to traffic jams or they will gradually kill themselves by breathing polluted air
So the best way for them to travel is public transportation
Each person should practice saving when using any source of energy to protect their own life
In conclusion , investments in developing public transport will be increased considerably , public transportation services hold great promise and its stance in the future ca n't be replaced
Hello Alex , how are you ?
Are you free for the weekend ? Do you have any plans
My friends and I are going to the cinema , and we would like to invite you to join us
If you are interested , find me at 8 o'clock near the cinema entrance
Thank you , Helen , for those wonderful presents
I always want to read this type of book
I went to the temple in the morning , followed by lunch at the hotel , and later in the evening , I went to the beach
In conclusion , it is evident that , because developing countries are facing political and economic instability , migrants travel in order to provide better education prospects and a stable environment for the younger generation to grow up
The effects of brain drain are that it creates a shortage of people qualified for professional jobs ; economic stability is affected due to a lack of people contributing to the economy
The cause of brain drain should be tackled at both international and national levels in a broader dimension and with a rational approach , for it is a global issue
In this situation , developing nations should take control of inflation ; focus on boosting the infrastructure and law enforcement to support the public positively
There is too little oxygen at the top of Everest to breathe easily
Jordan Romero was 13 years old when he climbed the Everest in May 2010
Mount Everest is so high that it is very difficult to climb
The top was reached for the first time by two climbers in 1953
My friends and I like TV programs , electronic music , and fashionable clothes
Sometimes we go to parties in the city , and I dance at the parties with my friends
They listen to the music and we are singing
It 's very good
Jason is my friend
Jose sings the best song
Another person is Angel , he does n't dance in any place
He prefers to study in your home
Hello , something !
My name is Steven and I 'm 14 years old
When I visited the secondary modern school
I 'm in grade 8
My life is difficult because I have to do everything
For example , there is a girl in my class who is beautiful
I love her look
Her eyes look like the sun
But she ignores me
I hope I can forget her
`` Run for your life ''
My favourite sport is running
I like running so fast , in fact , that it feels like I am running on air and my feet hardly touch the ground between the strides
My favourite place to run is in the forest , but I also like to run competitively
I like to feel the ground under my feet , which is so soft , not like the hard concrete of the footpaths in the city streets

In my opinion , television can be educational , whether you are watching the news or a show about World War One
Of course , it 's important to choose the right television shows
If you 're watching Tom & Jerry , it will hardly have any educational value
Although one could argue that you can always learn something , it 's also important to recognize when you 've learned enough
A friend of mine recently explained that if a zombie apocalypse should happen , he would be prepared because he has been watching The Walking Dead for some time now - so , in his opinion , he learned how to act in that case
Today I want to write about my job
I 'm a forensic biologist , and I deeply love my job
It is a job with a lot of interesting aspects
It is dynamic , stimulating , and even if it is not well remunerated , I feel satisfied
In the last few years , forensic biology has developed many aspects , like better sensitivity , robustness of results , and less time required to analyze a sample , but what struck me most is how fast these changes have happened
Television seems to be a controversial medium
Does television offer likely opportunities for the audience in an educational manner ?
Based on my experience , I believe that television covers both entertaining and educational functions
It notes how many educational programmes have broadened the horizons of young children over the past few years
It also notes that educational programs make decisions on what citizens should know and what knowledge future generations will be required to possess
Apart from educational contents , there are so many foul contents , such as business advertisements and fake information , on TV that citizens wo n't be able to tell right from wrong
However , I believe the educational programmes on TV still play a vital role in educating both adults and young children
I think that `` The Sailor 's Restaurant '' is the best restaurant where we can go
Here , we can eat typical Italian food
The last time I was here I ate the best pizza that I have ever eaten in my life
The atmosphere reminds the theme of the sea ; in fact , the walls are decorated with a lot of shells and the waiters are dressed like sailors
Also , it is perfect for our class because there is a lot of space , so that we can all sit together at the same table
The owner is a very kind person , and I 'm sure that he gives us a convenient price
Is there no future for public transport ?
Public transport is the cheapest way to travel , so it has a future
Currently , most people are used to using their own car to get to work or to go shopping , because it is more comfortable
But cars pollute the air with CO2 emissions every day , and contribute to climate change
So , if people were aware of this subject , they would n't use their own cars so much
In addition , having a car is very expensive
First of all , you need to be able to afford to buy it ; after that , you must pay for insurance , council tax , and mechanic bills , among other expenses
`` Whereas on public transport , you only have to pay the ticket ; you do n't have to drive , and if the bus or train - or whatever vehicle you use - breaks down , it is n't your responsibility
Besides , public transport pollutes less than cars
In conclusion , I think public transport has a future , and the more people use it , the more future it will have
I am an employee at your company
We are very pleased to receive your salary payment
But the pay is a little low
I completed many tasks , including tutoring three students with their complete summer homework , and diligently assisted the instructor with correcting homework
I work hard for two months and pay a lot
`` Your wage is much lower than I expected
I invite you to consider the proposal !
I think about the transport options that the government provides to help public transportation , for example , bus , train , metro , and more , because this improves the quality of life and reduces pollution
Travelling by car is more convenient in a lot of situations , but it could be annoying for searching for parking and the cost of fuel , and also maintenance costs
In big cities , public transport works well because there is good feedback from people
In contrast , in small cities , it ca n't be good in the same way , because it is not convenient for transport companies to invest money , as fewer people would use it
Tom Sawyer was a boy who lived with his aunt Polly
On Monday , Tom walked to school and he saw his friend Huck , with whom he talks a lot , and Tom lost a tooth
Then , he saw a beautiful girl named Becky , so Tom talked to her at school
Tom said to her about another girl , so she got mad and she ignored Tom
Tom was so sad because Becky would n't talk with him , so Tom went on a trip with Huck and disappeared for weeks
When Tom saw his house , he sneaked into his house and saw his aunt Polly crying for him
So , the next day , the people of the town went to church to attend the funeral of Tom , because many people thought that Tom was dead
The next day Huck went to Tom 's house to tell him that there was an abandoned house up the hill , so the two boys considered it an adventure
So they went to the mysterious house
the two boys heard that he was planning to steal some money and kill people , so the boys started their adventure on stopping Injun Joe
Hi jo
Thank you for your message
I will do my best to answer your questions
As for your questions , I think that you should work in a Japanese restaurant , such as a `` ryotei '' or an `` izakaya ''
That is because you will improve your Japanese skills through them
Recently , many Southeast Asians have studied Japanese in Japan while working in Japan
By improving their Japanese skills , they will have the opportunity to get a job in Japan
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake
He was at Sarah 's house when suddenly he left the bathroom dirty and then went to his house
So , he went back to Sarah 's house and cleaned the bathroom , but Sarah already knew the state of the bathroom
Hi Julie !
My school is located in the centre of Bangalore , India
My school has a unique reputation for its friendliness and the quality of education
I like my math teacher very much because her teaching style is very realistic and simple to understand
Good Morning
This is an essay about my favourite sport , which is swimming , since I was a child because I have always enjoyed it a lot
I do n't have friends who like swimming , almost like football or other team sports , and I always go alone
I said that because when I was eleven , my best friend had an operation on her back , and before the operation , she came with me , and every day I had to wait for her because she spent a lot of time in the shower cleaning her long hair
Luckily , the operation was fine , and she came with me , and since that day , I have been going on my own
Swimming is a relaxing exercise for me , and normally there are n't many people in the pool , but sometimes there are children , and I do n't enjoy it as much because they like disturbing me ; however , sometimes it is amusing too
I would recommend to people who do not know how to swim to learn how to swim , because I am pretty sure they will like it and later they can stop swimming
I think that dance is a way for self-expression
It 's not just a hobby , it 's more than this
Dance is a passion , a way of life
When I 'm dancing , I forget all my problems , except my stupid companions who do n't understand anything
But this is another topic for discussion
When you dance , sing or act , you are showing something to the public , something that is important to you
If dance is your passion , you practice every day , and you 'll keep practicing every day until you can
If you are tired , it does n't matter , because you like what you 're doing
You 'll wake up early to go dancing , or take dance classes
It does n't matter whether you go to sleep late or do n't sleep at all
That 's a joke
If you love dancing , you 'll understand me
Members of my family are numerous
I love my family , especially my little sister , she is sixteen years old , I consider her my best friend because I tell her everything about my life
I have a dog
He 's a loving dog , he knows how I feel
My oldest sister 's name is Cinthya ; she is really weird to me
our relation is not good because she is so different from me
Also , I have a brother ; his name is Jose Luis
My mom and dad are good guys
Actually , I prefer to pass my time alone , I am working in another town , so I stay away from my family
Hi , Mrs
Kate Ashby
How are you ? I hope you are well
To work in our cafe , you have to speak English , of course
Another thing that you must know is how to deal with people
We need someone ready to work long hours , because our cafe will be open every day
That 's all
kisses
For
We think that in the future , the planet will be in a bad condition and the trees will be disappearing , which will lead to wars
In 30 years , we will have undergone significant changes in our anatomy
The temperature will have risen dramatically due to global warming , so some people will have died because natural disasters will have become more frequent and intense
Technology will have advanced , and maybe cars will be flying on the streets , and computers will have changed completely
Because of this , we have to raise awareness of the current environmental issues and help the planet
Friendship is something extremely important in my life
I ca n't imagine my life without friends
How to make friends and meet new people
It is easier than you think
Let 's start talking !
Communication is the most important thing when you 're going to make friends
You have to remember that friends are not supposed to agree on every single thing
They just have to talk calmly about it
If your friendship is real , you will always find common ground between your opinion and your friend 's opinion
Just try , it wo n't cost you much !
Good day
My name is Fouad , and I would like to talk about my favorite sport , Volleyball , which is one of the most beautiful sports ever
Make me fit and healthy
This is a classy game with no friction between players
It exercises all the muscles of your body
Regarding the above , I advise all rookies to start practicing this sport and they will benefit greatly
However , adults can practise it as well and they will receive the same benefit
As citizens of our village , we totally care about the environment in our village
Every Sunday , we do a mutual cooperation where everyone works together to keep their surroundings clean and treat the environment as well as they treat themselves
We clean the dirty ditch , sweep away the rubbish , and then dispose of it
Whilst we recycle inorganic rubbish too
From inorganic materials , we can make bags , hats , and other things
Then they can sell them and earn income from it
The creator of heaven and earth , the creator of souls , the one who makes the earth rotate around itself and around the sun
What we believe as Muslims is that we were created by one God , who has no equal , the one who created our father , Adam , and from him created Eve
Transportation is the heart of any city , whether it is public or private
Nowadays , people prefer to own their vehicles rather than use public transport
Public transportation is declining day by day as people become crazier about their own vehicles , leading to a dark future for public transportation
Firstly , I agree with the given statement that there would be a tough time for public transportation in the near future , because people want privacy as well as freedom , which is almost impossible in public transportation
Secondly , this mode of transportation covers a wide range of areas
As much as possible , areas of the city or town that have mismanaged public transportation routines see people avoiding travel by these means
in competition with public transportation
Nowadays , people have numerous options for travelling , like many private companies
`` Which play an important role in giving tough competition to the government
I go for a walk to a park every day , with my two lovely Corgi dogs
I met many people in the park
I never thought that people have so many pets
At peak times , the park is very busy , even though the park is huge !
Some people are very friendly , just as their dog is
But , some people are very rude , and their dogs are aggressive to the other dogs
The family is the most important institution of social life
Every member has their own role , and the parents have to guide their team to understand the right behavior or attitude towards life
Usually , there are generational problems ; children do not understand parents and vice versa , but through dialogue and listening to emotions and facts , everyone can have another point of view
Parents must give rules to their sons to establish limits in social behavior but also must listen to others ' points of view to reassess and update their knowledge
A mother or a father can be a friend if there is communication and trust , and if someone gives their contribution to family duties
Recently I saw Mockingjay Part 2
If you want to see that movie , you need to watch the first three movies to understand it
The first movies were amazing !
The movie has a lot of action , drama , and romance
The fans of this series had been wanting this movie since the first one appeared , which was in 2012
I do n't think that this movie is for all the family because it is hard for little kids to understand
I think people will like this movie because it is very similar to the story of the book ; this is one of the first movies that is really based on the book
I hope you choose this movie !
It will be very cool to see the last part Mockingjay !
my favourite sport is Karate
First of all , I enjoy it because when I practise , I feel I can hold on for hours
When I 've had a very bad and stressful day , I can relax by doing karate , because it 's not a very hard sport
Training in karate is a way to forget your problems and escape your tiring routine
In my opinion , it 's very difficult to find this advantage with other sports
Apart from that , Karate is not just a sport ; it is also a discipline that teaches you respect , balance , and even culture
My teacher shows us how to behave with others
For someone who starts karate , it is easy to follow the class , so my advice is just not to get nervous and to keep concentrating on what they are doing
Technology is something that is very important , something without which we can not live
Today 's topic is Technology
Nowadays , we use technology in everything , from education to making clothes ; we use technology every day and everywhere
Technology is always upgrading and it is very helpful , useful , and important for development
Last year , my friend Michael was at school when he heard about a short story competition ; he liked the idea , so he decided to enter the competition
But there was a fee to join the competition , he had no money
He phoned me and asked me to lend him some money to register for the competition
He took the money on the second day
Travelling by car is n't so much more convenient unless it is significantly more comfortable , but actually , we do n't think about the pollution on our planet
Travelling by bus is very stressful because people push me or I ca n't sit down because there are n't any seats for me
On the other hand , in the future , we might have a bus that has a seat for everybody , and I wo n't have to stand up
Another public transport is a taxi or a car , it is much more comfortable too , but it is more expensive than a bus or a train
The AVE or an aeroplane is a good option for a long trip
In conclusion , in the future , there should be buses that are more comfortable

Dear Sir Dimara ,
I am writing about a problem in my city
I live in Patras , a big city in Greece
In my city , the walls of all schools and some buildings are full of drawings and writings
The vandalism in Patras has increased a lot
Unfortunately , when we tell somebody not to draw on the walls , they do n't listen to us
Our city is affected negatively because when new people visit Patras , they see many negative things
Patras is a very beautiful city , known for its culture and monuments
Why see that awful thing ?
Now that we have this beautiful city , we have to maintain it
In my opinion , the police should stop the vandalism
If it has police all around the city , nobody will dare to do graffiti , write something , or draw
I hope you will do something about that problem !
Yours faithfully
Jessyka Stavros
Around the world , pupils are waiting to finish school
They are eager to begin a new life as adults
But when they reach a transitional period , confusing feelings cross their minds
As a rule , after the last exams , they do n't know what university to choose
What they will do in the future , they can see , as if through a fog
In this way , the idea of taking a year off between leaving school and starting the next stage of education is very reasonable
First , it 'll allow young people to have a rest after the first hard work studying period
Ten or eleven years at school make them tired , although the pupils do not notice it
But choosing secondary education is a very important step , which needs a serious attitude
A year off would give future students a chance to gain experience in new professional spheres
They would also have an opportunity to be involved in volunteer activities
And thirdly , they might work to earn their own money or to travel
This year 's holiday would be really helpful for relaxation and getting new strength for future education
One year is not a long period
But the benefits after a year off will be obvious
I live in San Miguel Almoloyan , a village in the municipality of Almoloya de Juarez , in the State of Mexico
People collect trash from their houses and await the trash truck that carries the trash to a landfill located outside the village
Also , people go out to collect the trash that is on the kiosk , the church , or in the main places in the village
Dear Sir ,
I am interested in improving my English , so I would like to know more about the English course
Firstly , I would like to know how long the course lasts and the exact date , so that I can book my flights
Secondly , I do n't live in Cork , so I would be grateful if you could send me details of the accommodation that you offer in this course
And also , can you give me an idea of how much each option would cost ?
It would be useful if I could live with other students , because it is a good way to learn a language as well
Lastly , let me know if there are any tests I need to pass before starting
I look forward to hearing from you
Yours faithfully
Rosa
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately , after listening to conversations of his new neighbours
They are planning to rob a very precious thing from the museum tonight
He does n't have much time to prove his plan and he could n't wait for it to happen
It is his town and it is his duty to save the town 's history
He called the police and informed them about his neighbour 's robbery plan
Police reached the Museum and caught robbers red-handed

Hello , Estela !
How are you ? I hope you are well
I 'm writing to tell you about my last summer holiday
I went to Las Hurdes
I stayed at my boyfriend 's home for about a week
I had a wedding
While I was there , I did a lot of things
One day , I visited Meandro Del Melero
It was beautiful
And there was a wonderful view
The other day , we walked a lot and at the end of the way , we found a waterfall
The name of the waterfall was Chorrituelo
It was spectacular
On my wedding day , I had a great time , and as a result , I slept very late
The wedding was in the morning , and in the afternoon we ate in the restaurant with other guests
However , in the night , we had dinner in a garage and there was a party , all night
You should visit Las Hurdes
There are a lot of things
The people are very nice
English is an international language and is important for the modern world
In China , English is considered a foreign language that many students choose to learn
They begin to study English at an early age
They spend at least one hour learning English every day
Even kids in kindergarten have begun learning simple words
That is a good phenomenon , for English is essential nowadays
In addition to , some people think English is more superior than Chinese
`` In my opinion , though English is of great significance , English is , after all , a foreign language
It is hard for people to see eye to eye with each other
English helps us read English original works , but Chinese helps us learn about the true China
Only through its characters can Chinese literature reveal its brilliance
Learning a country 's culture , especially its classic culture , the first thing is to learn its language
As we are Chinese , why do we give up our mother tongue and learn about our own culture through a foreign language ?
I was at a fantastic restaurant , Woolypools , last month
It is small but comfortable and famous for its big burgers
Woolypools is a specialty meal , it 's a restaurant
In my opinion , the restaurant could be improved , particularly with regard to its meat dishes , but it is perfect for having dinner with friends
I expect to be more famous , better , and biggest
The problem with the restaurant is its location , which is far from cities and populated areas , and its space , which is very small for a large number of people
In this life , we have many things that make us happy and keep us going
For example , a present or a gift is especially meaningful if it is from your best friend
Once , I got sick and stayed at the general hospital , and my friend gave me a flower
It was my favorite flower I have ever had
In my town , we created a small organization to promote a healthier environment , add a touch of beauty , and make it more attractive
I agree with the opinion that famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time
It is horrible to have someone behind you all the time , which means you do n't have a life , peace , or happiness
In addition , all persons have the right to privacy and to be free
Nevertheless , journalists are always taking photos , whether they are eating , drinking , happy , or sad
This is terrible
So , politicians and film stars will support it , because then they will have to bear the consequences , and they will then have the reward for what they earn
This is all
Good morning
How are you ?
come here !
Get down !
Get into the room
Get into the bus !
Let us walk
Let us play cards
Let 's sleep
Let me in ?
Let me go !
Let me see your photos !
Let me watch your house
Allow me to enter into your cabin
Forgive me
Bring that toy !
Bring a glass of water
Drink water !
Eat food !
Run fast !
Stop shouting , do n't shout
Let us bathe
Once upon a time , there was one little ant called Penny
He hated to be like that because most of the ants made fun of him until one day something horrible and inevitable happened
It was a dark and rainy night
All of them tried to find a way out , but no one could find one
People just started to evacuate rapidly when a big earthquake began
Penny was too sad ; the only thing she could do was to wait and remain calm
Until dawn , all of them went out , so they were scared until they found a refuge
Everyone wanted to witness the queen , but no one found anything
They were like very religious ants ; they prayed to their sacred ancestors so that their ancestors could help them with the big task
Something that they do n't know was that the whole thing was a movie !
So , everything was planned
The actors had monitors that watched the ants all the time
One day , Penny discovered it and went to tell her queen
So they make a plan to display all their artwork
The next day , when they were about to start filming , there were no ants there , so they searched for them , but they could n't find them
At that moment , the ants and Penny attacked them from behind , making them leave the place
The ants win the war and they expand their habitat into the studio
No one attacks them again and they lived happily ever after !
I have many favorite sports
`` I 'm most keen on playing basketball
I usually play basketball every day for at least thirty minutes
After a hard day at the university , I go home and then I head to the stadium to play a sport
One thing I make sure of is that I finish all my work before I play my favorite sport
Basketball has many benefits not only to me but also to everyone
It makes me feel relaxed and able to unwind
Besides helping with other things , it also helps me keep fit and stay in shape
I really care
I am excited about playing it
When I have spare time , I often gather my friends to watch a basketball match on TV
I often play basketball at the stadium in the morning
Sometimes , I play sports near the sports center
I went back home and slept soundly when I had finished it
Basketball is an outdoor activity
That is the reason why basketball is my favorite sport
With the sweeping progress of development and the booming of population , many agricultural lands , forests , and oceans have been destroyed to build more infrastructure and transport networks
From my own perspective , I believe that it will bring many drawbacks not only to the environment but also to humans and animals
To start with , there is a wide range of troublesome things that may be leading to this phenomenon
Convincing arguments can support that the root cause is that almost all the present-day cities are already packed with places such as residences , commercial areas , and recreational spaces , and the land available for new housing developments is increasingly scarce
Additionally , people now continue to destroy more agriculture and forests in order to satisfy all their needs , which will destroy the ecosystem 's diversity and biodiversity , especially the endangered species
According to the problems mentioned above , various approaches that the government should adopt to deal with these problems include reducing building construction from now on and planting more trees instead
Sustainable development should be awareness to all humans and we should start to protect the environment and preserve the animals
To sum up , this unpleasant phenomenon and these problems should be resolved before things become worse , and the governments have to take responsibility for that
Nowadays , languages are very important , and English even more so
This is not my first time studying English
I have been studying English since I was a child , but I never spoke and learned it so well until I decided to take a course in London to learn the language
I made that decision because I was tired of trying to learn English and I did n't have the level of English I wanted , so when I heard about that opportunity , I jumped at the chance
The car is n't the best way for transport , because it produces much pollution ; however , public transport is better for journeys
It can carry many people without any problems
Nowadays , in developed cities , there are many possibilities for public transport , such as buses , trains , subways , trams , etc
This situation creates a lot of pollution to the environment , so we need to be more conscious of the planet 's health
I want to say something about the learning of the English Language , it is hard for me for the following reasons :
First reason : the grammar that the learners , teachers , or institutes teach , is like the Spanish Language , my native language
`` I want to say that it is very difficult to understand the conjugation of verbs in the Spanish language , especially when you imagine yourself in the same situation but speaking a non-native language
Secondly , in English syntax , the structure for constructing paragraphs or sentences is such that the verb is written before the subject , but not always
Is there anyone ?
The third reason
I love to play cricket
I am enthusiastic about this game
My favourite team is India because I am from this country
In India , 85 percent of people follow cricket
In 1993 , Indian cricket team won their first world cup and that changed the direction of the air in favour of cricket and everyone started to follow this game
I love this game because my favorite sportsman plays this game
His name is Mr
Whenever I play this game , I always follow this person
His stance , style , and shots , as well as his running between the wickets , are all up to the mark , covering everything that is most required in this game
Not only I but also every Indian always follows Sachin in cricket
When he was 18 , he played his first game for India
He is the first player who played 200 tests in cricket
He has many achievements , such as scoring 200 in one day
I love the way he played
For a start , they have to decide what they can do better , batting or bowling
If a person wants to become a bowler , then they should concentrate on running , action , and stance
Also watch videos of some of the best players , such as Sachin , Rahul , Sir Don Bradman , Hayden , Wasim Akram , and Brett Lee , etc
As health is an important factor in every sport , we also need to improve our health and stamina
Dear Jo
I 'm glad you 're visiting my country
I am looking forward to this
I can give you some advice on traveling and working in my country
I wish you have an impressive time
The weather is neither hot nor cold all year round
If you want to travel to this city , I can be your guide since I have a year off before I start university
This is a modern city
People usually go here for shopping or eating
There are many local foods that are very popular
You may like this book
I also want to introduce my friends to you , and we can have fun together
When you have played enough in this city , and you want to find a job here , then you can start looking for one
I can recommend you to my uncle 's company to do a job
Because it is difficult to get a job here if you are a foreigner and have n't finished college
It may take a very long time to find a job because you do n't have much time here
You may consider my advice
My favorite sport is swimming
It 's because swimming is really fun
I also think that swimming can keep our body fit and it can make swimmers feel cool on a hot day
The advice that I give to someone who wants to start swimming
One should not be afraid of water , otherwise they may not learn to swim , and also , when they get older , it will be more difficult to learn than when they were little
So , this is my advice to them
Dear Camp Director ,
My name is Eider and I am 21 years old
I am really sure that I am the one you are looking for
I monitor in my free time , and I am looking for a temporary job to improve my English
I have no problems working in a kitchen , which will be clear if I tell you that my parents own a bar
According to my age , I have found that evening activities are not a problem , and I have played many sports throughout my life , such as soccer and volleyball
Waiting for your answer , Eider
The village where I live is small
All residents take great care of the environment
An organized effort was made , where everyone cleans up the village
All residents should segregate their garbage and throw it into suitable containers
Thus helping to protect our environment , to make it clean and safe , so as not to jeopardize our health
In my village , there are trash cans , so that no one throws debris on the ground
There are special places where you can organize bonfires , but everyone has to clean up after themselves and throw out all their own garbage
We have access to renewable energy sources , such as the wind power plant , which is located nearby
Recently , batteries were also set on the roof of the primary school , and as a result , the whole school now uses solar energy instead of traditional electricity
They organize monthly meetings on the environment , and residents participate in them
All residents of my village try so that our village remains clean and pollutes the environment as little as possible
Travelling in their own car is way more comfortable than taking a ride in public transportation ; there are several reasons to consider
Firstly , the bus always drops by to pick up a passenger who takes more time than expected for the travel time
Secondly , the public vehicle routes are farther than the usual routes
Thirdly , it is also crowded , with no privacy
Finally , there is a risk of becoming a victim of theft or a pickpocket
However , public transportation is much cheaper than buying a new car , and for the adventurer who wants to have an exciting trip , it allows them to see more and experience more action
I enjoy watching outside , sightseeing , and mingling to meet different people
In addition to this , I also admire the bullet train in Japan , which I consider a fast and safe mode of public transportation
To sum it up , I still consider having one 's own car is much safer and more convenient
Public transportation will not be viable unless they have a project to reduce travel time and prioritize the safety of their passengers
As far as I 'm concerned , I disagree with the decision to extract minerals
More details and reasons will be elaborated in the following paragraphs to support my opinion
To begin with , extracting the mineral will be harmful to our environment
There are breathtaking sights on the outskirts of my hometown
In my childhood , I went there every summer to spend my vacation
However , it will probably disappear if the developing equipment is set
Next to go will be the extraction of the valuable mineral , which will definitely lead to air pollution
There is an example of another town that is polluted due to mineral development
No one can deny that the pollution issue , one of the most important things , should be prevented
Last but not least , the mineral extraction will have a profound influence , especially on our offspring
Taking my friend Taylor as an example , her homeland was over-developed and became an arid place when she was a child
After she grows up , she decides to leave and never go back to her hometown
In addition , she has no vivid memory of her childhood
One problem is that some people will consider the job opportunities it may bring
Due to mineral development , many people in our hometown can earn much more money than before
It seems like a sought-after chance
Nevertheless , they do not give us any promise about the vacancy
In addition , money is no longer crucial when it comes to health and environmental conservation
In a nutshell , based on the reasons and instances above , the disadvantages of extracting the valuable mineral outweigh the advantages
Therefore , I do not subscribe to this decision
Limiting cars on the roads would lead to a decrease in pollution
The fossil fuels used by vehicles cause global warming
Global warming is a serious issue , and higher temperatures make the ice caps melt
The longer we bury our heads in the sand , the warmer the Earth will be
I am learning English to improve the general quality of my sentences
I do n't believe in it , especially since cars are not flying
Even if it were to happen , there are many people who ca n't get a car because it is too expensive , not only for buying but also for fuel , service , and other expenses
Buses are simpler : you just buy a ticket
What about trains ?
I watched TV about trains in Japan , which is the future of public transport
I want to see a blue sky and not traffic like in the film `` The Fifth Element ''

Dear Carlos , I hope this message finds you well
We apologize , but your air conditioning order number 6 is incomplete
We are aware of this mistake , which arose from confusion about the number of air conditioners before our telephone conversation with your secretary to confirm your purchase
Because your order was confirmed too late and since the order was n't made in advance , we could only send 5 pieces
Since the units were sold from our inventory , but your purchase confirmation indicates that you should have received 6 pieces , please do not worry - we will send you the remaining unit as soon as possible
We hope you will continue to prefer us
Yours sincerely

My name is Chew
I 'm 25 years old and I am from Malaysia
I have 3 siblings in my family whom I take care of all the time when my parents are busy with their work
During my school days , I like to play volleyball , and I 'm an excellent player
We used to organise competitions and tournaments with other schools
This is my favourite sport
During my leisure time , I like to help my parents in the kitchen
We cook a variety of foods and dishes
I enjoy working in the kitchen , even when it means getting my hands dirty and oily
With reference to the above , I would like to apply for the Summer Camp job with full commitment
Contemporary art is a controversial issue nowadays
There are many sources and creators , as well as themes
It is well known that many art curators and artists believe that contemporary art is not a valuable source of art , since many artists only create based on simple ideas of an aesthetic image or a philosophical idea
Luckily , the most expensive art remains the old work , such as that by Picasso or Freud
Nowadays , many seemingly vacuous art pieces are being sold at auctions around the world for extraordinarily high prices
Experimental art has taken the world of art by surprise
Humanity has reached a level of differences where it would not be possible to stop
So now we have many choices and an infinity of information available at any given time
With this stated , we now have an idea of how artists create
The sports days were held on Kwai Chung Sports Ground on 12th and 13th November
The weather was partly cloudy
I got there by the MTR
I arrived at the sports ground at 7:40 a
On the first day before the sports day begins , we have the opening ceremony
The athletic representative passed the torch , and we sang the anthem
After that , the sports day began formally
At 10:45 a
There was a funny thing when I went to the mall
The teacher called my name twice , and he told me to stand in a different place
So I know that there was someone whose name is pronounced the same as mine
Before the race , I was very nervous
When I was running , I heard my housemates cheering and the wind passing my face
That feeling was very comfortable and made me feel relaxed
At last , I ranked number 10 out of 27
Although it is not a great result , I 've already tried my best
At the end of the day , our school announced the marks that the four houses had got
My house is number two
I felt hopeful and wanted my house to be the champion
On the second day , my classmates called me to take part in the inter-class relay race
I felt very afraid because I was not good at running
Finally , our class was the first runner-up
We have a difference of 0
I prevented my class from winning the championship
At last , my house came second runner-up
I hope my house will become the champion next year !
`` There is no future for public transport because travelling by car is so much more convenient
In my opinion , this statement is not correct
We should use public transport because , at present , there are many cars in the world that pollute and , unfortunately , we are harming the environment
It is best for all people to go to the place by walking or running , as it is more healthy
There is nothing wrong with it
I think travelling by car is more convenient , but I disagree that there is no future in public transport
It is commonly debated that tourism has greatly influenced not only the aspects of one country , but also those of the whole world
Whether tourism has had a positive or a negative impact on our lives , it remains quite a dilemma for the ignorant
First of all , tourism is a tool that enables people to travel all around the world
Alongside its development , the ability of traveling has eased to the point where it is now quite common to commute from one country to another
The existence of multinationals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism and the idea of globalization , since a traveler is not only a citizen of their own country but also a global citizen
Secondly , tourism , especially in developed countries , has played an important role in their growth from an economic point of view
There are countries , such as Greece or Bulgaria , in which the economy relies merely on tourism
If tourism influences the economy , it thereby influences the environment
At a small scale , in cities , it is possible to design infrastructure in a way that will allow citizens and tourists alike to reach important places more efficiently
At a large scale , people can now travel in almost any possible way : by land , by sea or by air
The development of tourism has given rise to cruises and train vacations
Once upon a time , there was a tiger who lived in a beautiful landscape with her boyfriend and her 3 daughters
The tiger 's mother , Amanda , was 25 years old
The tiger 's boyfriend was a lion named John , who was 27 years old ; his dad died after a conflict with other animals , which led to an infection
Her mom died because something dragged her by the leg and dropped her in a cave where other animals ate her
They died when John was too little to remember , and he never knew what happened , so he went to all the places to see them ; he walked and walked , he even walked backwards , but he never found them
The three daughters were so different from each other
The first one is named Amanda Junior , like her mom
`` She is one of those who tend to make something happen
The second daughter , named Elizabeth , is the intelligent one in the family and the oldest
Was 12 years old
Other animals are given rewards or bonuses because she discovers that water is a liquid
The last daughter was Ana , who was the youngest in the family and was also known as a jaguar , possibly due to her fierce personality or a nickname
She is staying in bed and doing nothing all day
Their parents were angry because she was the only one who never works
Some animals went with Ana and gave her an incentive to be an athlete , rather than sleeping
The end
Hello friend
I know you are searching for a flat for next year
Maybe I found something for you : when I was on the bus on my way back home , I read a journal with some advertisements
There is a nice flat near my home , it is perfect for someone who wants to live there for only a year
There is a little kitchen , a great bedroom , a bathroom with a shower but no bath , and a cool living room
I think you should bring winter clothes with you because the weather here is really cold
Write to me soon
Alessia is a beautiful name
Hello Riley , about the question you asked me in your letter , it has been hard to give you an answer because I know how much you love both options
Last night I made a decision
I think that you should give up on your music classes
You have been taking classes since you were nine years old and you already know how to play the piano
This is my opinion , but the decision is yours , so once you have made your decision , please send me a letter telling me about it
Love , Ines
`` Hey , my name is Joe , and I 'm 21 years old , and I think I would complement the summer camp very well , because of my good manners and being very open to the kids , so they can open up and speak
My current job is as a nurse at the local hospital , and I can do many things that a doctor can
So , if the kids are going to hurt themselves , then I 'll be able to fix them up instead of taking them to the hospital for small things like bruises and small injuries
The most exciting day of my life was the 3rd of June last year
I had an exam
On that day , I woke up early because I was feeling nervous
Then I revised Maths at home before going to school , and then at school before beginning the exam
When I started to read the text , I felt agitated , and I thought that I was n't able to finish and pass the test
But when I finished ahead of time , I was happy and relaxed
I have always been sure that I passed the test
And this is true
I passed that test !
Hello Charlie
I 'm really enjoying hearing from you
Congratulations to your sister for her prize
I would like to go to a new art competition , although there are n't many competitions of this kind in my city
My favourite sport is football
When I was three years old , my parents took me skiing
At the beginning , I went to the kindergarten and they taught me skiing
It was a lot of fun because I could n't do it
At twelve o'clock , my parents took me with them , and we drove together
My father took me between his knees , because I could drive without falling , and it was fun
When I was older , I could pursue my dream , which was snowboarding , but I should learn to ski perfectly , just like my parents
Later , when I was 16 years old , my dream came true
I had my first snowboarding lesson and I loved it
I took every free minute to go snowboarding
That was the story of why I went snowboarding
I enjoy snowboarding , because I feel free when I am going down the piste
You are like a bird
It is the best feeling in the world
You are very happy , and sometimes I sing a song , and the world is perfect
That is everything I want to have and I 'm lucky
That 's why I like the winter more than the summer
Snowboarding or skiing is an excellent sport for anyone who wants to clear their minds
Although you spend most of your time in nature , if you 're lucky , you can see animals
It had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had accomplished something really good
Yesterday , he was on his way home and it was getting dark
his parents were worried and called him a couple of times
He started walking very quickly
Everything was dark
She opened her eyes and the first thing that she saw was the black sky
A dark sky was without stars
She got up , and looked around
She was in a part of the woods where she used to go to think and relax
She started to regain consciousness , although she could n't remember how she arrived there
She had to walk at least 15 minutes from her house to get to this place
The problem is the last thing she remembered is that she had been sleeping and then suddenly woke up when the wind opened the window
She fell asleep again , did n't she ?
How did she manage to walk all the way there in her sleep ?
If she was n't awake , she could n't remember anything after that
This situation was really frustrating , not to mention that now she had to walk for almost 20 minutes to get home and go back to sleep
She started to walk to clear her mind
She knows her way even in the dark
The development of humankind in technology is seen everywhere
In the case of transportation technology , in the twenty-first century , we have various options like planes that can fly with the clouds , trains that are fast and big enough to carry hundreds of people and travel hundreds of miles an hour , and boats that are much bigger and faster than in ancient times
Although compared to ancient times , we are lucky enough that we have all these options
However , if I had the option to choose between all three , I would say plane
There are three reasons to choose this
The first reason is its speed ; compared to all other means of transportation , it travels faster
It can travel thousands of miles in a couple of hours
As a result , people can save their time
Secondly , safety is a priority because , compared to others , the chances of an accident are less
That makes it safer to travel by plane rather than the train or a boat
The third one is about comfort level
Plane is much more comfortable than both train and boat
In conclusion , the plan will be my first choice of all three means of transportation
The reason behind my choice is speed , safety and comfort level that make this plan my first choice
Everyone should take a year off between leaving high school and starting college or university , in order to earn money or travel , as it would be the best experience for a student who has attended high school
The young people want to discover the world and travel to reach places which would be unreachable otherwise
I had a wonderful day yesterday because I was at the beach all the afternoon
I went with my parents and my sister
The beach is located in A Guarda and its name is O Muiño
There are a lot of people on the beach
The water was very cold and I could n't swim , so I played football on the beach
I waited for a very long time and then I went to a cafe and I had a drink
It was a nice day because I had a good time with my family
`` Is there no future for public transport ? Is this a true claim ? ''
Will we see public transport on our roads after 5 or even 10 years ? That is a really interesting question
I think that it all depends on the development
Now , we can see that more and more people prefer traveling by car
Yes , I agree , if you planned the travelling for a long distance and for a long time , you would prefer to do it by car , because , firstly , you 'll spend less time , your travelling will be comfortable , you 'll have the possibility to stop anywhere and for as long as you need
But if we are talking about travelling across your city , would you prefer public transport or a car ?
I think that this is the question for everyone , and the answer ca n't be one for all , because someone can use public transport , and by doing so , not only save money but also help the environment
In my opinion , even after 10 years , the public transport will still cross our street with a sufficient number of passengers
Hello Lara
Thank you for your email !
My name is Mohamed , and I am a 28-year-old man from the Kingdom of Bahrain
I go to the gym and run on a daily basis , to keep in shape and maintain good health
Looking forward to getting to know you
My village is the place where I live , so I am trying to keep its environment unpolluted and viable for life
To attain this goal , I will take steps to protect the environment as follows :
No smoking is allowed in public places
Increasing the number of trees and punishing the person who cuts them
They are establishing the factories outside the village
We must protect the water sources and the sea
Guide people and give them information , details , and guidelines about pollution
I 'd like to tell you about my favorite restaurant , its name is `` Lemon ''
Volleyball is one of the most difficult sports in the world
I have been practicing volleyball for twelve years , and because of it , I have met a lot of people who have helped me grow up in the sport and in life
When I was 10 , I chose to play with a group of girls older than me , they were good , and I could n't believe the experience
Volleyball is my favorite sport because when I 'm playing with my team , I am in another world , where I feel free and happy
You should try practicing it 's so funny , but I advise you , it 's not easy at first , but you have to try many times , as you should do in life
On weekdays , I get out of my bed at 7 in the morning to go to my work , which starts at 9 AM
I often go to sleep around 12AM
I usually play video games if I do not have any homework to do
I am not a big fan of sports , so I do not play any sports
However , I sometimes skip to keep fit
Michael woke up in the morning , and he read the newspaper
He read in the newspaper an interesting article
The notice was about a competition
The competition is about writing stories
Michael was excited because he is a great writer
First , he found an idea for the story
He began to write
The story was very good but Michael did not know how to end the story
Finally , Michael ended the story , and then he went to the post office
Michael sent the story , but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake ; he did n't put his name and address
Yes , I think TV can entertain and educate , because there are many comedies
Also , there are lots of educational channels
I think historical channels are very interesting , because you can learn new things about the past
Comedies are so funny , so when you are sad , you can watch one of them
There are many discussions about the future of the public transport
Different experts have talked about this question , and there are several opinions
People like to have the freedom to move comfortably and therefore , some people usually prefer to use their cars
Public transport is usually restricted by timetables , and you can only use it at the times allowed by the timetable
Because of this , many people do n't like to use public transportation because they want to be able to move around as they need
On the other hand , public transport is better for the environment , because the pollution is less than when using your own car
Finally , in the future , the convenience of people will likely determine the use of cars more than public transport
Susan is a little dragon
Her skin is a combination of red and green , with red dots on top of the green to be more precise
She does that every day after school
Of course , she also has a little brother
His skin is red , just like his father
Dear Paul ,
I have n't written to you for ages , but I was very busy with the exams at university
What about you ? What 's new in Brazil ? As you know , my friend John asked me to help him with the organization of a concert that was performed last month
`` So , I was there , something like part of the staff
My work consisted of creating press advertisements , providing all tickets , food , and other necessities for the musicians
I got two free VIP tickets , so I took my girlfriend and we went there together
When the concert finished , we went backstage to get the musicians ' autographs
I felt like a star
People were so envious
Next time , I would like to do something similar , and I suggest you try it as well
It 's a dual effect !
I hope to see you soon
John is here
The advertising is everywhere
There are ads on TV , radio , buses , and streets
In spite of this range of media , the TV continues to be the most important means of communication
A lot of people think there are too many ads on television , but is that really the case ?
On one hand , it 's true that one programme or series that we see contains a lot of references to products or services
There can be people tired of too much advertising content , however , advertising is completely necessary
There are a lot of products that need to be announced , and there are also many messages that need to be reported to the public
The TV is the most accessible way of communication and people can see the message through it
In addition to one aspect , there are many things , including one industry
In one ad , for example , there are the publicist 's work , the company 's investments , future sales , and the product or service 's life
To sum up , there are a lot of ads on TV but they are necessary and beneficial for everyone
My favourite season of the year is summer
Why am I making this choice ? You can clearly ask , but the reason is that I love the sun and good weather
Yes , it is true that during summer , the temperature is very hot , and you can rarely stay near the sun because you get burned by it
In spite of this , summer is a very good time to enjoy the little things in life and have fun with them
During the summer , I love to go to the beach and go sunbathing with my friends , as well as having fun with them , playing volleyball or running in the sea !
I think those activities are very refreshing and they make you forget about the heat of summer
Furthermore , you can sleep more than on the other days of the year , and this makes you feel relaxed
I really like to explore nature during summer , too
The wonderful colors of flowers in the sunshine are fabulous
Dear USA Summer Camps Team ,
I saw your advertisement in the USA and I 'm very interested in the childminder position you are advertising
I 'm eighteen years old and I 'm doing a languages translation degree at university at the moment
I have some experience working with children of all ages , and I do n't mind hard work and I learn quickly
I 've just received my FCE certificate this year , but it would help me a lot to practice my English in an English-speaking country
I consider myself really active , sociable , well-organized , and patient ; therefore , I think I 'm suitable for this job because I can adapt easily to any situation or environment , including working overseas
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon !
Yours faithfully

It had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had accomplished something really good
He finally , after 5 years , won the swimming competition
It was really important for him because he had been training for 5 long years since he was 15 , and he had n't achieved anything
He was very happy , so he decided to celebrate by going out with friends
He invited all his friends from his team , and he threw a party
Tom wanted Mel , his girlfriend , to come too
She was really proud of him
She was dreaming about being his wife
She wanted to be his wife so badly
But he did n't love her enough
He wanted to break up with her at that party
He was waiting two hours for her
He hated that she was always late
That was the main reason he wanted to end it
When Mel came , she looked gorgeous
And when he saw her , his heart started to beat faster and faster
But time 's up !
He got closer to her and told her everything
Mel looked sadly at Tom , then said , `` I 'm pregnant
He followed and apologized to her
He said he was drunk and did n't know what he was saying
Then he hugged her
He said he loved her , and kissed her forehead
He had to stay with her because of the baby
He could n't just leave her carrying his baby !
No , he has never acted like this !
He knew that he had to stay with her the rest of his life , and raise the baby
He decided to give up swimming and started taking care of Mel
One day , Mel was feeling really bad , so Tom took her to the hospital
He felt that something bad was going to happen
And he was right
Mel and her partner have lost their baby
Tom had to make a hard decision
His life was going to change
Mel was crying all day and Tom could n't stand it
He has broken up with Mel and it made her much sadder
He did n't care
He thought it was her fault that she had lost their little human
The surfer was gliding in the waves
Even if I am not very interested in training , my favorite sport to practice is swimming
The sensation of being embraced by the water , feeling weightless , able to perform a wide range of movements that are impossible in the air , is a wonderful state of mind
I started to practice swimming in a pool because I was n't able to swim at all , and I wanted to learn
I have been taking lessons for six months , so I have improved my abilities so much
If you are not a good swimmer , you miss out on a big part of the pleasure of enjoying the water , both in the sea and in the pool
Practicing swimming is quite hard work , especially if you need to learn the basic movements , but it is a very relaxing activity
I recommend that you do n't have to give up before trying , because it is fairly simple and it can give a lot of satisfaction !
Your efforts will be praised by those who succeed , and you can achieve success with practice
Introduction
This report will examine the different activities we can do in our leisure time in Castelldefels
·Activities to kill time
As our town is well-known for its magnificent beaches along the Mediterranean coast and for the Olympic Canal of Castelldefels , many foreign or local people come here to do activities like kitesurfing and windsurfing on the beach or canoeing and water skiing on the Olympic Canal
These activities are the most popular , and they are also the most expensive
However , I fully recommend them , especially for sporty , adventurous and young people
Other ideas to have fun
In Castelldefels , there are other activities that are less popular but cheaper
As I said , these activities are not as popular as those at the Olympic Canal and the beach , but their success is increasing more and more
·Recommendation
So finally I suggest that it would be a great idea to combine the different types of activities , both popular and new
If you try all the activities , you would have a great time here in Castelldefels !
Hi Jane !
How are you ?
I was glad to hear from you
I 'm writing to tell you the best way to arrive at Salou
You will come to the Reus airport , right ?
Well , the airport is located just outside Reus
You have to take a bus because it is more economical than taking a taxi
The bus stops at the Salou bus station
When you get off the bus , you should ask someone where Spring Street is
It 's near there
You can walk to my house
`` I send you a map to locate the street
This is my address , 4 Spruce Avenue
I 'm planning my visit
I 'd like to visit museums and monuments , and go clubbing with you
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon !
Best Regards
Mary

Nowadays , there are many people who are learning a foreign language
Firstly , there are more multinational companies that require their employees to speak multiple languages , therefore people who know how to speak a foreign language have more job opportunities at major companies and will have more chances of being promoted
On the other hand , there are more benefits , for example , if you want to travel to another country , it is very useful to know another language , because you can understand everything without any complications
Finally , learning another language gives the learner the ability to step inside the mind and context of that other culture
Today , globalization is bringing the world closer , and that means there are more possibilities to have contact with other cultures , for example , in literature , poetry , films , TV programs , music , and other aspects of culture
On balance , learning foreign languages is very positive in different aspects , so if you are positive about learning a new language , do it , because it will bring you many benefits

Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing to complain about a recent package I received last Monday
I ordered two batteries , model 002545 , because my mobile needs this type of battery , but I have only received one battery , model 001212
One month ago , I ordered two model 002545 batteries from your website
I have a mobile , a Nokia 1214 , which needs batteries , model 002545
The delivery was wrong , so now I am in a huge hurry because I need my mobile for work every day
If I do not have a mobile , I will not be able to work
To resolve the problem , I would like to receive the batteries via express post
The delivery error was made by you ; therefore , the order should be sent with free delivery this time
If I do not hear from you within the next two days , I shall be forced to contact my solicitor
You can only contact me by email , because my mobile still does not work
I hope to hear from you soon and to receive my batteries at my home as quickly as possible
Yours faithfully

The aim of this report is to evaluate both the positive and negative impacts of users ' opinions on the Active Leisure Club recently
First , people in this area have found a suitable place to enjoy their time through a wide range of activities and games , which are creatively and effectively held and suitable for different ages
Besides , it has enough modern facilities to serve the users during peak hours , and the guides are everywhere , ready to give help
However , the only thing that we dislike
With the purpose of attracting more people , besides its good points , I highly recommend that they arrange the time suitably and avoid holding the activities to avoid problems
A diagram is given showing the process of making bank notes
Designing the bank notes is the first and indispensable step
People should decide the background color and the artwork while also considering the security issues
Then , skilled machinists would prepare the metal plates for the next step
The third section is to print the prepared bank notes
Usually , there will be 50 bank notes per sheet
The colour will print on both sides , and every note has its unique ink ; also , the images will be slightly raised
After that , the most significant stage is to inspect the quality of the printed sheets
People usually divide the items into three parts : good quality , partially damaged , and poor quality
As for good quality sheets or partially damaged sheets that are still good , people will cut them separately and pack them together for dispatching and distributing banknotes
If the partially damaged sheets are bad , they will be treated as bad sheets and will be securely destroyed
In conclusion , the diagram gives a quite explicit process of making bank notes
Even though it seems to be easy to make them , every step needs to be taken carefully in order to produce perfect bank notes for everyone
A better place to live
Beginnings
Everything began a few years before , when Alfred , The Major , read an article about the importance of surroundings in the health and happiness of people
He started to think about how he could improve our lives , and he found a solution
A concerned population is worried
While youngsters use their time trying to inform the oldest people in the village about the importance of taking care of our surroundings , middle-aged people have planted many trees around the village and cleaned the floors of our public places , making the village a more attractive place to live than it used to be
Easy recycling
Local authorities helped launch this initiative by creating some places for people to leave their rubbish to be taken to the recycling center and give new life to our waste
The results are promising
Thanks to Alfred 's great idea , we enjoy one of the cleanest villages in the area
People are now worried about the future of our planet , and an association called Green Planet has been created to promote the care of our planet
We want a happy Earth
Hello Luis Blanco !
I 'm writing to you about the staff recruitment for the `` New Cloud Generation '' project
So , we need your help with some questions about the process
For your information , we are looking for people with three years of experience on similar projects , who are engineers and also have a high teamwork skill
We also value that they have specialized studies in Cloud technology and hosting management
However , it 's possible that we do n't find enough people with the desired profile , in which case we could accept people with one year of experience
Is it possible to have the meeting this week ?
`` When and where would you prefer to meet ? ( Remember that I work from 8 a
Finally , I need you to prepare some profiles that you think the staff of New Cloud Generation should have , and please tell me if you find a different request than I mentioned in the email
Please answer me with the information as soon as possible

Dear Paul
What 's up ?
Do you remember when I told you I was helped at a concert ?
It was a really exciting and unforgettable experience and I enjoyed it very much
You probably wo n't believe me ,
In general , I had only one main duty , which was checking the quest list , and in addition to this , I had to help in cleaning the area after the concert
But that concert was worth it , so I hope I will be invited to their next event
Working for them was a real pleasure
I suppose we 'll see each other soon and I 'll be capable of talking to you about this experience
Love

Report : This document outlines the findings and recommendations from our recent project
The aim of this report is to give you my view of the course I attended at your Madrid branch last month
In addition , I would like to offer some suggestions that I believe are worth considering for the next course , which will take place next year
First , I would like to acknowledge the outstanding classmates in my class
They were not only exceptionally clever people but also excellent coworkers
Working collaboratively is , in fact , the most interesting way of learning any subject , including English
Second , the teachers were really good at teaching
They , our team leaders , managed to encourage all of us every single day
This way , we made the most of our time and never gave up on improving our English level
Third , phonetic classes scheduled on Fridays were really handy
They helped me to pronounce words better than I could before starting the course
However , in my opinion , there should have been at least one native teacher in the team of teachers
This way , we had been able to hear a native speaker , and I think it would have been worth practising
To wrap up the report , just say that on the whole the course was fantastic and I am looking forward to taking it again next year
Yours sincerely
Juan Orozco is a person
I am keen on cinema , so I love to watch all types of films
But what films are in my Top 100 list ?
In my opinion , Babel is a fascinating film with a dramatic and thrilling storyline that is one of the top 100 best movies
I really enjoy it because the plot is original and it shows different life stories of characters that move
In addition , I think that the settings are very realistic and the actors had great performances
Therefore , I recommend that fans of the drama genre watch Babel because its message is moving
It reveals that our feelings cross the boundaries of all cultures , and we are connected to each other
My name is Mohamed El-Shamoun
I am 20 years old , living in Port-Said , Egypt
I am a student in the 3rd year of the Faculty of Medicine at Port-Said University
My father works as a teacher , and so does my mother
I have one brother and one sister
I have been doing Judo for the past 11 years and have won a lot of prizes
My hobbies are travelling , reading stories , and writing my thoughts
I am interested in scientific research and analyzing information
It is not just a dream in my mind , but I work hard to make this dream come true
Over the last two years , I worked in many places , such as a pharmacy , a restaurant , and the water purification company
I believe that work and experience are fundamental , and the understanding that experience can lead to remarkable achievements in life motivated my choice of this program , as I desire to acquire more knowledge and skills through learning and study
In my childhood , my dream was to become an engineer , but after changing my career path to medicine , I realized that Allah chose the best path for me , considering my personality
When I do anything , I feel that I have the world in my hand , so I can do anything for people
One of my goals in life is to invent an effective drug for some of the incurable diseases like cancer , AIDS , and hepatitis
I have often asked myself , what is the aim of our life ?
What are the benefits of working and studying ?
But if you see your world and understand it well , it will be deserved by everyone to work so hard and achieve their goals
I learnt from research that you can do everything at any time , and even a little change can change your life for the better
I like travelling and visiting new places in my country , and my dream is to travel to all the countries in the world
I am writing with reference to the job posting as a camp monitor that you advertised for the summer
I have seen your advert this morning , and I am really interested in it
Although I am a young girl , I think I am a qualified person for the post
I am a preschool teacher and I have experience looking after children from 3 to twelve years old
I am also good at working in a team
I do not like to be or feel alone ; this could be one of my greatest weaknesses
I really love being with people all the time
I do not think being young will be a problem
Instead , I believe it is an advantage
Young people are usually hard-working and active people
If you require any further information , please do not hesitate to contact me

I would really appreciate it because I am looking forward to starting work
Is there a future for privately owned cars ?
To be honest , I am not sure
Although privately owned cars are becoming more and more popular , and they are increasingly becoming a common asset even in developing countries , they are unlikely to be the primary means of transport of the future
Most people today realize that in our cities and on our planet there is an increasing problem of space and pollution
Carbon-based fuels will not last forever
I would say that most probably private cars are not `` sustainable '' in the long term , and it will be necessary to return to some sort of public transport
The population growth forecast tells us that in the next 35 years the world population will increase by a staggering 3 billion human beings
I know that it is nice to dream of a future where technological people fly around , each with their own private small helicopter
But it is not going to happen
I guess that in the future , there will be no helicopters , and not even cars
States and local authorities will have to tackle the problem and provide the public with a better alternative
`` The price for independent transport will grow dramatically ''
I reckon that will change the habits of the public
Even though we will have to read the timetable and learn to be on time , the old train could regain its importance
Imagine this picture : in the first class of this semester , students are yawning and do not pay attention to the teacher ; while the teacher asks for the answer , students can not answer because they completely can not remember what they studied last semester
Students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying , partly because after the long vacation , students will not remember the knowledge they have learned , partly because the long vacation allows students to get used to having fun instead of studying , and partly because some difficult courses require continuous study
Therefore , I agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they were to spend 11 months a year studying
More reasons and details will be shed light on in the following paragraphs ,
To begin with , there is a general consensus that students will forget the knowledge they have learned after a long break
For example , in history class , the history teacher has to repeat teaching the history of North America before he starts to teach the history of South America at the start of the semester
It is a waste of time and not efficient
Next in line to benefit would be students , who get used to relaxing by having no studying or homework during their long vacation
For example , when the semester starts , students can not get away from the sunshine , beach , and travel
In the class , students will recall the joyful time they had instead of paying attention to the teacher
Last but not least , some difficult courses require continuous study rather than allowing for a long break time
For instance , learning English should be a part of your daily routine ; if you go a long time without learning English , you could forget the vocabulary or the grammar
In a nutshell , as mentioned earlier , I totally agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they studied for 11 months a year
My favourite sport is soccer
I enjoy this sport , which I have played since I was a child ; I always remember when my father and my brother taught me to play it
My father was a professional soccer player , so I think that I inherited this love for soccer
I played soccer in different teams in my neighborhood , school , and university
I always enjoy playing soccer because when I am on the playing field , I forget all my worries
I like to speak with my teammates
`` Together , we analyze the rival team and choose a strategy to win the match
when I play badly I feel nervous but my partners give me their unconditional support
That is priceless
I know health is very important , so if you practise this sport , you are likely to be healthy
So , if you 're starting this sport , it 's because you really like it
If you do n't like it , there are many options to practice whatever sport you prefer
Soccer is not a violent sport , but sometimes it becomes violent
In this way , you have to be prepared for any problem
I highly recommend that you enjoy playing this awesome sport !
On my vacation , I went to New York
I also went to the amazing Niagara Falls
Something that made me happy was to see my family
On September 12th , 2014 , I went to New York City
In flight , I was very happy because I received a lot of food
The flight was approximately five hours , during which I watched beautiful movies
When I arrived , my uncle was waiting for me , and I gave him a big hug
We went to the Long Island because he lives there
He has a really nice house , and I was happy to see my little cousin , Angel , who looks just like me
In New York , I eat so much ; I also went to the city that never sleeps , Manhattan
My uncle had the excellent idea of going to Niagara Falls
We traveled by car , and the trip was about 8 hours long
Finally , we arrived at the city of Niagara Falls , which looks like a ghost town
There is n't much to do , but there are waterfalls
I was amazed by how huge the falls were
They were incredible and beautiful
I take too many photos because you do n't visit places like that every day
One thing that made me very happy was visiting my family
My uncle Juan lives in the United States of America , and I was very happy to hug him because I miss him a lot
My cousin Angel was very happy to see me , and I was too ; we are as close as siblings
My aunt gave me a lot of presents because she said they do not see me frequently and many other parts of my family
To conclude , my vacation was perfect , where I saw new things , visited awesome places such as Niagara Falls and Times Square , received a lot of presents , and especially ate a lot of delicious food
Most students attending universities are away from the city where they used to live , so , they need an accommodation to live through their study years
Most universities provide cheap accommodations , such as shared rooms and dormitories , to their students because most students have low incomes , in order to lower their living costs
Other students who may have financial support from their families prefer to hire an apartment to live independently
Sharing houses or rooms has many advantages , such as being cheap , safe , and close to the university , which also teaches one how to share everything with others
In spite of all these benefits , I prefer to live in an apartment where I can express my personality
Many years ago , I shared a room with a friend for a few months during a course outside my country , which were the worst days of my life
They are annoying me
Although the federal government , which plays a crucial role in the USA , has many benefits according to the reading passage , the lecturer believes that there is no perfect government
The power of federalism , which has more liberty for the states to have their own policies according to their needs , is not always good for the country where it can create conflicts between states
An example of that is same-sex marriages , where some states recognize this type of marriage , while others do n't
Also , the reading passage declares that even though the federal government lets each state function independently , it still controls the main decisions
This case presents some problems in which the lecturer mentioned the failure of the federal government to stop illegal immigration to the USA through the Nevada Desert
The control of the federal government is the reason why each of the states and the federal government blame one another for the rising unemployment in some states
In conclusion , the federal government , which is powerful and gives freedom , can cause many problems , such as a lack of unified policy and confusion over responsibilities
Travelling to a different country can be both exciting and frustrating at the same time
I think that any type of trip is exciting but also has its frustrating moments
In order to enjoy travelling to Mexico , I would give two pieces of important advice : first , try to get along with your travel companion and enjoy Mexican food instead of criticizing its spicy flavor
People say that in every voyage , people experience different moments of the trip : arriving , feeling frustrated in an unknown place , bonding with their travel companion , succeeding as a traveler , and arriving home in triumph
To enjoy a trip to Mexico , I suggest that the traveler find a way to get along with his or her companion
This minimal chance would make a big difference when you visit another city
As an example , if you are able to get along with your travel companion , you could enjoy each moment of the trip , share some photos , eat together , and visit places of common interest , such as museums or malls
Other advice that I would give to people coming to Mexico is to enjoy Mexican food
Mexican food has a lot of tasty dishes from different parts of the country
For example , there are a lot of American people that do n't like spicy food and most of the time could get angry with the excess of pepper that Mexican people use to prepare their food
As a piece of advice , I would suggest asking for sauces with less pepper
In this way , the visitors would be able to enjoy Mexican food that is less spicy and has the same delicious flavor that is so characteristic of our country
In conclusion , I offered two important pieces of advice for visitors who are coming to my country : try to get along with your companion in order to have fun and try to enjoy Mexican food because it is delicious !
After the Internet was first invented and revealed on August 29 , 1969 , social media sites were the next most significant innovation that has partly replaced face-to-face communication
Social media platforms such as Facebook send out 700,000 messages , and 170,000 tweets are publicized on Twitter every 60 seconds
Unsurprisingly , the social consequences of Facebook and Twitter play an important role in communication , regardless of distance or time
However , people who use Facebook , Twitter , or SMS in general are not likely to have their own personal privacy , which increases the possibility of bullying
This essay will focus on the benefits and disadvantages of Facebook and Twitter , and also discuss the potential future implications
Communicating can be achieved , regardless of distance , through Facebook and Twitter
The benefit of being connected globally through Facebook and Twitter is that it allows for instant message transmission to anyone
Firstly , Facebook and Twitter can be used when their users are in an unpleasant mood , and where their negative feelings are expressed
Secondly , Facebook provides the opportunity to remain in touch with the daily activities of friends , observe relationships , and express one 's own feelings within the network through wall posts , pokes , messages , and so on ( Oldmeadow , Quinn , & Kowert , 2013 )
That is to say , human behaviour on Facebook is interacted with by sharing our moods and receiving our responses
Thirdly , Facebook can serve as a tool for organizational communication in business
Knowledge about the members increases continually
( Emerald Group Publishing , 2013 )
Finally , people are allowed to follow anyone whom they find enjoyable through Twitter
For instance , by following the famous celebrities , people can easily see their daily activities that they post
However , due to these circumstances , people who are being followed , or users in general , may have less personal privacy , and they are also at a high risk of being targeted with aggressive behavior
However , information that appears on Facebook or Twitter is easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily respond and express their public opinion
However , information that appears on Facebook or Twitter is easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily respond and express their public opinion
Mostly Facebook users expect their friends to respond or pay attention to what they post or share
In fact , along with agreeable and pleasant comments , there are also small amounts of aggressive and even racist comments
First of all people can post any racist comments that target a specific group or person
For example , after the premiere of The Hunger Game , a fan posted a racist tweet stating that they were unhappy because one of the main characters was played by a Black person ( Rauch and Schanz , 2013 )
Due to the accessibility of information via SMS , it has led to many problems involving cycle-bullying , cycle-badgering , and cycle-stalking behaviour ( Krishna , as cited in Williams & Merten , 2008 )
For example , Krishna et al
The individual , X , was admitted to a state psychiatric hospital after being found not competent to stand trial on charges that included stalking harassment , trespassing , and telephone harassment
576
Potentially , Facebook and Twitter , and SMS in general , may replace face-to-face communication and improve the functionality of these platforms , because people feel they have more freedom or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter without having to view each other 's appearances
Therefore , it would be easier to be connected and keep in touch with friends in seconds , rather than having to call them
The possible outcomes may be that the more time people spend on SMS , the fewer communication skills they have
In addition , to decrease the risk of negative comments or posts , Facebook and Twitter would improve their features to better address personal privacy problems
For example , we can control what posts are sent by adding more privacy options
However , despite the usefulness of these implications , people should be aware that Facebook and Twitter could affect their social life by avoiding their use most of the time
In conclusion , the benefits from using Facebook and Twitter are that people can communicate and stay connected to their friends frequently
People can easily reduce their negative mood by sharing and expressing their feelings
In contrast , because Facebook and Twitter are connected worldwide , protecting personal privacy is probably impossible
Possibly , users might express aggression towards each other because of a lack of privacy
Photography classes are available for everyone
Introduction to the topic will be provided in the following paragraph
Teenagers are constantly influenced by social networks like Facebook , Instagram , Pinterest , etc
Photographs are included in all of those sites
Also , this phenomenon of taking photographs is part of our daily life because it is the best way to capture special moments like birthdays , travels , and special occasions , etc
As a new college subject , it has been introduced to attract more students
This practice refers to those activities that anyone can do without any special preparation
However , teaching students how to apply better techniques when taking a picture should be considered as similar to learning to draw
Both skills are required in today 's world and must be developed in the education system at an equal level
The reasons are numerous
Recent studies show that in the last twenty years , more than 3,000 photographs are taken per person , especially in the lives of the younger generation , including teenagers and kids
This increase is related to the overwhelming development of technologies , such as computers , cameras , cellphones , etc
Also , photography is considered a type of art , so it requires special skills and techniques
What lovely weather today !
What a wonderful day ! It is April now , and finally , spring has come
A bright sun is shining , and the snow melted away in March
The first birds of spring came back from the warm countries
They are singing sweetly and building their nests
People look happier
They have been feeling tired after a long , snowy winter
We set our clocks forward one hour in March
The summertime was first introduced in England in 1908
The days become longer , and the nights become shorter and lighter
We usually set our clocks back one hour in October
A lot of people are happy because they can sleep for one hour more
Hockey is a lifestyle
Although all sports help you live a healthy life , hockey provides you with more than just physical health or fitness
What are you thinking of when you choose a sport ?
Do you think that your lifestyle will improve ?
You are mistaken
To do different kinds of sports , you need to be skilled or willing to try new things
What if you do n't have any of those requirements ?
Then you know hockey is the answer
Hockey is a sport I have played for many years , and it turned out to be my favorite sport
It 's a good way of learning how to communicate and work with people , in simple words
it 's a team sport
However , it 's not always as simple as it sounds
You have to train five days a week and need to concentrate a great deal
On the other hand , I enjoy every second of it
Throughout my life , I have been willing to improve in this sport , and since 2010 , it has become a lifestyle
I will recommend this to you
It would definitely help you to grow and improve as a person
Hockey will change the way you see the world and you are going to start seeing it with new eyes
Stop searching for the right sport ; this one is for you !
As far as I 'm concerned , public transportation is the best transportation for environmental protection
Despite some people making enough money to buy their own car , electric and hybrid cars are more expensive than traditional ones ( those that use gas or diesel ) , so people choose these , and that 's because pollution is an issue that we have to deal with
Environmental care is gaining strength every day , from kids to old people
The government and many companies are measuring the CO2 emissions produced by industrial or service processes necessary for producing goods for social consumption
If people do n't use public transportation , they could walk , ride a bike , or buy and drive a car , and that will probably happen when the destination is far from where you live
From my point of view , public transportation will be very important in the future , especially in developed countries
I think the government will reduce the fare in public transportation , that could encourage people to use public transportation and care for the environment by reducing CO2 emissions and mitigate global warming
In the Coslada City Council , people are well informed about taking care of the environment
The city council has developed several campaigns to improve the awareness of its citizens , and for example , children learn at school how to separate waste
There are many ecological islands
Each of them has three or four kinds of bins , and these bins are located within two hundred meters
There have been several planting campaigns to plant trees and clean the banks of the river Jarama
Nevertheless , it is never enough , because dog owners are to blame
Since 2008 , there have been many bike paths across the city , so citizens will be able to avoid cars and thus emit less air pollution
The organic waste is picked up every day , and plastic and paper waste are picked up every other day
The most important thing in environmental care is the education of children
Our planet is in such a difficult situation that we have to address the problem
A problem that was caused by us , human beings , in pursuit of making money without considering the consequences
My family is very aware of this trouble , so we make every effort to solve it
We usually use the public transportation , which is of great quality in the city where I live
It works perfectly : it is always on time and the price is worth it
We live in a cottage , and we have several bins , which are classified according to the material that we want to recycle
Moreover , we run an organization which pays people who bring us the materials for recycling
The benefits are given to several organizations which take care of the environment
My sister teaches people what to do with things they want to get rid of , such as bottles or papers
She is able to create such beautiful jewellery that many people follow her
It shows that this kind of thing can have a second life
The southern border of Egypt is located where the last river ends
The Nile River is the origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization , which is over 6,000 years old
All historians , researchers and scientists agree with this
And as for me , I totally support their point of view
Egypt is one of the river civilizations amidst the huge Sahara Desert
At all times , the Nile is the only source of water for the Egyptians
Furthermore , a rise in the river 's water level helps people realize the possibility of increasing the fertile land
The Egyptians called their country 'Black Land ' to mark it from the red soil of the desert
Nowadays , the deep and wide valley of the Nile has become the most important transport line for Egypt
Through the centuries , people have been exploring the nature of the Nile
The ancient Egyptians divided the year into three seasons : the inundation , the growth , and the harvest , which corresponded to wet and dry periods
They knew when it would be the 'Green Nile ' or 'Red Nile ' to stock up with clean water
But such a high level of development of Egyptian civilization has not only a positive side but also a negative one
The great amount of dams was built on the river , which caused the disappearance of many plants and animals
Many Egyptians still live far from the main water artery of the country and can hardly find clean water to drink
But I hope that as soon as Egypt becomes a developed country , the government will pay attention to the serious ecological problems
When most people think about an important historical place in Italy , they think of the Duomo , in Milan
But the Duomo is not the most important landmark
I am sure you 'll agree that it 's the Colosseum
For centuries , this building has been the symbol of this city
It is quite ancient , but still fascinating for thousands of tourists who come every year
It was built in 79 AD by Tito , who was the Roman emperor
It was used for shows featuring animals or humans who were killed without pity
Moreover , naval wars were represented in order to celebrate the victories of the Roman army
It has been ruined over the ages , but now people understand its importance and take care of it
In my opinion , it is important to remember our past and our traditions , which we should n't forget
However , not all people are aware of it
It 's our strength , and every time I move forward , I realize how many people have succeeded in building it
That 's why it is important , as it helps us understand that we should never give up and instead follow our dreams
In this fast-moving world , transport has become an important factor for the everyday activities
Everybody needs a means of transport to make a living
There is no point in saying that public transport has no future
Travelling by car is a convenient mode of transport , but most of the population can not afford it
There are advantages and disadvantages in using public transport
Firstly , to discuss the benefits of public transport , it is cheap and affordable for all classes of people in society
A variety of buses are released by the government to meet people 's financial needs
Using public transport is a waste of time and has no privacy , which are some of the disadvantages
Similarly , traveling by car has its own advantages and disadvantages
Not everybody can afford traveling by car as it is costly , but to discuss the benefits , one can enjoy the benefits of high privacy and convenience during travel
It is sophisticated and can travel faster
In summary , it is not appropriate to say that there is no future for public transport because both have equal advantages and disadvantages
Sometimes I think that Taipei is too crowded
There is no denying that the MRT in this city is such a convenient metropolitan system
However , during rush hour , there is always such a rude person who has no regard for others
They occupy too many seats , including priority seats
Furthermore , most of them are students
They do n't respect other passengers , just keeping laughing and teasing each other , despite the fact that some people have told them not to do this
Moreover , I think that providing seats to elders is also problematic
Priority seats are reserved for those who need them , not only the elderly but also some adults
Somehow , you can not identify all of them , whether they feel uncomfortable merely by their appearance , leading to some misunderstanding between them
Some people even blame them for occupying the seats instead of offering the seat
Moreover , some old people would take this considerate action for granted and they would even command young adults or students to offer their seat rudely
In my opinion , the transportation in our city has nothing to criticize except that
Everyone should develop an awareness of good public manners
Television is an important part of modern culture
We depend on television for entertainment , education , news and films
TV has many benefits
Firstly , it enables young people to share cultural experiences with others
TV can act as a catalyst to get kids reading , by encouraging them to follow up on TV programs by getting books on the same subjects , or by reading authors whose work was adapted for the programs
Certain television programs can teach kids important values and life lessons
Educational programming can develop young children 's socialization and learning skills
News , current events , and historical programming can help make young people more aware of other cultures and people
Documentaries can help develop critical thinking about society and the world
TV can help introduce youth to classic Hollywood films and foreign movies that they might not otherwise see
Cultural programming can open up the world of music and art for young people
But television has also negative effects : first of all , the children who spend a great deal of time watching television get less exercise
In addition , these children receive less socialization with other children
Television also takes away from the family time
This is also true for families who eat in front of the television
I deal with consulting and sales of financial products and services for an international bank , in the mass market and small business
I follow the relationship with customers from acquisition to the advice until the realization of contracts , building and maintaining relationships after sales with the aim of customer satisfaction
I also worked with large and small teams in back offices , managed many administrative activities related to mortgages , personal loans , accounting , and investments as well
I worked for several years on the acquisition of new customers , aiming to provide them with a complete service , including products ranging from account services to insurance products , investment products , personal loans , revolving credit , and cross-selling products
Over many years of work , I have honed my skills in managing non-standard situations , analyzing problems , and finding and implementing practical and easy solutions
Handling non-standard situations involves analyzing the problem , finding , and implementing practical and easy solutions
I have faced several situations where I always work with serenity and enthusiasm ; I also like to work in a multicultural and dynamic environment
I 'm careful to meet the team 's goals , cooperating with my colleagues to achieve them by providing my skills
I have worked at the same large company for 25 years , and now is the time to change and find a new job opportunity
My husband has been living in Zaandam , and I need to find a new job in Holland so I can rejoin my family
I like sports such as skiing , riding , and swimming
Nowadays we all hope that public transport can save the world
When we see all these cars on our roads , when we get stuck in a traffic jam , we think that one day we will have to leave our cars and use public transport
If we do n't do it , one day we 'll wake up in the eternal traffic jam
But probably , this situation is only a period of development in transport
We are told about a lot of innovations in this sphere
For instance , Google reported about Google Mobile
Maybe robots will be able to drive smarter than people
If they contact each other and use Google Maps or similar services , they will be able to avoid accidents on the roads
This will allow people to avoid traffic jams
Not all people like the idea of a Google Mobile
Some people think it might take away their independence
However , some people think that it is not such a bad idea , because they believe they can still drink even though they are driving at the moment
However , there will always be people who dislike being a driver anyway
And there will always be people who hate public transport
The question is , what kind of people have the most impact on the world , and who will decide
How many languages do you speak ?
Did you ever think of learning another foreign language ?
Do you want to be a polyglot ?
Today it is more important to learn a foreign language than before
there are several reasons which show you why it is important to learn a foreign language today
First , if you are planning to travel to another country , it is absolutely useful to speak the local language , it makes your trip easier and more comfortable
Secondly , to find a good job , business is increasing at the international level ; speaking a foreign language certainly adds value to your profile , which can lead to a higher salary
Third , through learning a foreign language , you do n't only learn a language , you also get to know its culture , get to know a different culture and society different from yours , which enriches your knowledge
Over the years , more and more miserable accidents have happened around the world
From newspapers , magazines , and even foreign media , we can easily figure out that our environment is changing severely
Many scientists infer that people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years because of human greed
Humans always desire to have a more convenient and comfortable life , yet they forget to protect and cherish the Earth
High-tech countries have built many high-rise buildings on their lands
Various factories emit excessive carbon dioxide into the air
All the examples above will enhance the temperature and make the Earth hotter and hotter
The higher the temperature , the worse the living quality is
If people around the world could n't put more emphasis on our living places , we would have a dark and hopeless future
As a result of climate change , the weather is so hot that people may even face a water shortage
If one loses too much water supply , a person 's body will become weak
In this living situation , instead of laughter and happiness , there will be more fights , hatred , and sadness
Everyone lives in despair , but can not find the entrance to brightness
The terrible consequences are caused by humans ' unsatisfied hearts
Friends , from now , let 's be members who protect and take care of our Earth !
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it
The undercover work is very hard , not just because you will work with dangerous people , the real danger is getting discovered
When people know that they were deceived , that their trust was broken , heads will roll
You have to be precise , fast , and an excellent actor
The passion for the cause is the key to survive should be changed to The passion for the cause is the key to to survive , however `` to to '' is not grammatically correct , a better way to phrase this would be `` The passion for the cause is key to survival '' or `` The passion for the cause is the key to surviving '' but if we want to keep the original sentence structure , a minor change would result in `` The passion for the cause is the key for survival '' or simply `` The passion for the cause is key for survival '' but if we want to keep `` to '' then `` The passion for the cause is a key to survival '' would be a better option , however the most straightforward correction would be `` The passion for the cause is the key to survival ''
It is just something that I had to do , not you or her
I did n't choose that ; this job chose me
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I would like to apply for the position of beach lifeguard assistant , which I saw advertised
For the last two years , I have been joining the swimming group at the university
I managed to succeed in many competitions in the country and abroad
I believe I am a suitable candidate for this post , given my swimming skills
On the other hand , I completed the first aid course with the Red Cross
The job would give me the opportunity to use all the experience I have gained , and what is more , it would provide me with new knowledge
`` Please do not hesitate to contact me should you need further information
I am available to attend an interview at your convenience
I look forward to hearing from you
Yours faithfully

In our modern world , many people suffer from stress that stems from life conditions
In addition to this , people are working in very stressful workplaces and they want to escape this condition on holiday
Therefore , it can be said that holidays are the best option to renew one 's soul and revive one 's spirit
During the holidays , people can get away from daily problems and also spend more time with their friends and family
In this respect , many people prefer to visit natural surroundings with their families to escape the bad situations in their lives
For example , walking on the beach or swimming in the sea can be helpful to forget difficult living conditions
On the one hand , holidays are the best for people in terms of thinking clearly about their life experiences
People can review their decisions more accurately and find it helpful during the holidays
For instance , in stressful conditions , people can make bad decisions that affect their future
Besides , people underestimate emotions in their workplaces
The reason is that people must complete their tasks to earn a living and they neglect their emotional needs , such as love , helping others , and spiritual reflection
It is clear that during holidays , people come closer together and reconnect with their loved ones
For example , people meet their relatives whom they have n't seen for a long time
At the same time , people have a chance to go to sacred places to renew their spirits and souls
They can pray to God , and it gives relief to people
When people remember these emotional and spiritual subjects , they can become happier
During the holidays , people have time to review their mistakes that lead to a stressful life
In conclusion , holidays are very suitable for people to heal their problems and stressful lives
Holidays are very helpful days to revive their spirit and soul , because people have a chance to move away from modern life that is full of material things
Cycling to school , to work , or for other activities is not a common habit in Spain
However , the government and the local councils of big cities , such as Madrid and Valencia , are trying their best to promote this movement because they consider it a way of sustainable development
On the one hand , there are many benefits of cycling
Firstly , it reduces traffic jams , noise , and pollution , and it also lowers CO2 emissions
Furthermore , it turns out to be the quickest method of transport
On the other hand , there are some issues , such as an increase in danger on the roads
Statistically , cycling is generally considered more dangerous than traveling by car
Another disadvantage is the weather
Getting wet when it rains , having to make a lot of effort to cycle into strong winds , experiencing freezing weather , or having to keep drinking when the weather is hot
From my point of view , cycling contributes to improving community spirit , and solutions to its disadvantages can be found
No one can deny that travelling by car is much more convenient than travelling by public transport
For example , people who take a car do not need to spend time waiting for the bus or subway
And this undesirable time might not be so short during holidays , due to a less frequent schedule
Also , we can drive a car to any place that public transport can not reach
When the bus is crowded , we have to stand , making us more exhausted , especially on long distances
Even though cars provide us with many advantages , the advantages of travelling by public transport should not be neglected
First , public transport is good for the environment compared to a private car
As we all know , the more people use public transport , the fewer emissions are emitted per person
Recently , several studies have shown evidence that there is a strong relation between car exhaust and lung cancer
In other words , public transport plays an important role in protecting human beings from suffering from diseases and saving lives
Secondly , public transport saves space in cities
As more and more people choose to live in cities , our cities are becoming larger and more crowded
Correspondingly , the space for each person becomes more limited than before
Provided that every citizen owns a car and uses it rather than public transport for all their travel needs , I suppose that our streets would turn into one giant parking lot and everyone would spend more time in congestion
Last but not least , public transport allows people to do other things that are impossible while driving
The drivers must pay constant attention to their surroundings , which results in a stressed state
For a passenger , however , travelling is complete relaxation
People can listen to music , take a phone call with a friend , read a fascinating book or just look outside
Although there are many advantages of public transport , it is not necessarily the best choice for every situation
For example , it offers less flexibility than cars and is less environmentally friendly than bicycles
Therefore , it is unreasonable to conclude that one mode of transport can replace the others
It is better for people to be aware of the pros and cons and choose the right one
Languages for the future
Should we learn other languages ?
We live in a world that changes day by day , and people need to develop their skills and overcome challenges
I think there are many reasons to learn languages
On the one hand , it could allow you to communicate with people , learn about different cultures , and travel around the world without the language barrier
Also , in recent years , it has become essential to express yourself in English , French , German , and Russian , as this is very important for finding a job
I think one of the great disadvantages is the price of the course
I also consider that it tends to be challenging and leaves little time for other activities
It seems to me that young people should spend more time studying languages because it will be profitable in the future , but to achieve this , they will have to be motivated and enjoy the learning process

Dear USA Summer Camps ,
I am writing in response to your advertisement for a job
I had a part-time job as a babysitter and I took care of my 11-year-old brother very often
I worked in an Easter camp too , and I have already prepared a lot of activities , like rappel and paintball
For these reasons , I think I have the skills for the job
I can be contacted for a meeting at the address mentioned above
I hope you consider me for the job , Rodrigo
Today , I went to my Winnie 's home with Adriana in the afternoon
We ate delicious food and played interesting games all together
We had a great time
At 2 o'clock in the afternoon , we arrived at Winnie 's home
First , we listened to some songs , such as `` Almost '' and `` Big Big World ''
After thirty minutes , we had tea
Winnie loves to eat a lot , which is why I can easily find a lot of food at her home
We had mouth-watering strawberry cakes and juicy apple juice for tea ; they were extremely yummy
After having tea , we play hide-and-seek altogether in Winnie 's garden
Adriana and I hid behind a bench , and Winnie looked for us
Suddenly Winnie fell over a little stone
Adriana and I immediately came to her and held her up
Your knee is bleeding
Are you okay ? I asked
I was shaking like a leaf , and my heart was pounding since I was worried about Winnie
I had butterflies in my stomach
I felt relieved then
Then Adriana found a plaster and put it on Winnie 's wound
Winnie felt warm inside and smiled happily
I felt happy today , although Winnie hurt herself
Why ?
`` Our friendship is stronger
What an unforgettable day !
In my opinion , the house will be better in the future
A house of the future will be big and bright
It will be full of conveniences
Big spaces will be divided into a few zones
Relaxation , learning , kitchen zones and so on
In the house of the future , there will be automatic curtains reacting to the light
Television will be cordless , just like the Internet is at present
Every house will be flexible
Thanks to this , it can expand or reduce
Everything depends on the number of people
Swimming is my favourite sport
Why do I like swimming ?
Well , swimming has always been an Olympic sport
It is a sport that requires a lot of fitness and can be learned at any age , but children can start learning to swim as early as two years of age
Swimming has different types : dolphin , crawl , backstroke , and breast-stroke
Swimming as a sport is very useful in weight reduction if you are obese and need to reduce your weight ; it is also the best sport for people with asthma because it strengthens the chest muscles and decreases the vulnerability of those patients to respiratory infections
When you start to learn how to swim , choose a place that has an experienced coach and try to join a group of people your age
Hello Paul !
I enjoyed helping at the concert , which was held in Antalya on October 12th
I had a great time with people who work as helpers at the concert
I got a lot of experience from them
At the time of the concert , everyone can enjoy , but nobody thinks about how they prepare for the concert
I saw so many interesting things during the preparation time
For example , they know everything about each helper 's jobs , but at the same time , they are only concerned with their own subjects
I want to explain to you some interesting parts of my experience
In the morning of the concert , we were excited and thinking about the concert , and we decided not to think about the concert , just do the job that would be assigned to you
When we were arranging a concert plan , we shared the work among all of us
Some of them started designing the stage , while some of them were checking the songs ' volume and lights
My job was to check the list of songs that singers would perform
I think it was the most difficult part of the concert because of the singers ' performance
They had always wanted to change some songs that were on the list
At the time of the concert , I was really worried that something unexpected would happen
Actually , everybody can be worried because people generally invest a lot of time and effort into things that matter to them
Finally , the concert started , and all the lights were shining like stars
It is difficult to explain that feeling
When the concert finished , I felt like a bird flying freely
Of course , I had some pain in my legs because I was standing all the time
However , I like to volunteer for projects that I find enjoyable
I would like to invite you to our next concert , which will take place next month
I am waiting for your email
See you !
Technology is changing the way we live in many ways , and particularly in how we receive and use information , which has been the most impacted
Regarding advertisements , technology has a huge and not always positive impact on outdoor advertisements
From black-and-white ads posted in public places , we have moved to being practically surrounded by outdoor ads placed in every available and imaginable spot
Technology ranges from buildings with enormous and bright screens to interactive bus stop signs
The recent developments in mobile technology allow advertisers to offer personalized advertising to each of us
I 'm sure that in the very near future , if I look for restaurants in Mallorca on my computer or mobile at home or on my way to work , I will see ads on the buses - which will be displayed on screens , not printed paper - showing images of Mallorca , or an ad from TripAdvisor featuring Mallorca
It will suit me sometimes , and it will even be useful , but I 'm also sure that sometimes I will find it aggressive
The way it feels to enter a square or plaza in my town and find it full of bright screens is aggressive , no matter how beautiful or artistic the pictures displayed are
Advertisement might be considered an art , or at least some pieces are really artistic
But technology is here for better or for worse , and we have to learn to deal with it to the best of our ability
If I could change one thing in my life , I would change my house
I 'd like to have a big detached house in the suburbs of Artem or Vladivostok
So that I could live more freely and independently
If I had this house , I would decorate it in modern style
I would build a gym , a wardrobe , and a swimming pool
If I had such a house , I would like to have a barbecue area in my garden
I could invite my friends and relatives
Together we could spend time in a pleasant atmosphere
When it comes to my favorite sport , tennis will always be my answer
Though I am a beginner at it , I think it is interesting since it requires a lot of skills to be a master of it , which sounds very challenging
When I feel stressed , I always play tennis to release tension
If you are a beginner at tennis , my advice is that you need to get a suitable racket first
As the proverb goes , if you want to learn something well , you need to get the right tools first to work on it
Next , you are required to learn basic skills step by step
Since tennis requires a lot of basic skills , if you do n't learn these important techniques slowly and steadily , you may get hurt while practicing
Finally , finding a good teacher is also critical
A skilled coach can teach you the best skills of tennis
Do we have better television than we had a few decades ago ?
Do we have enough choices on the screen ?
Can you imagine having only two TV channels and having nothing to watch for the whole day ?
That was only 30 years ago
An explosion of channels arrived in our houses in the eighties
In this report , we will see some characteristics of today 's television
The number of channels is gradually reducing
In our country a decade ago , when digital TV arrived , a lot of new channels flourished
All TV channels tried to get several licences to distribute their shows
In order to resolve some budget deficits , there are currently mainly two major TV groups
Fewer channels mean fewer choices
The popularity of Internet TV is increasing
It costs less money , and you can choose exactly when and with whom to watch this or that television program
You follow a suggestion made by someone
You just clicked on it
They have to reduce their budget
Despite changing channels , we see the same news
Big broadcast groups are used by all of them
It is expensive to keep journalists and cameras all over the world
It is cheaper to buy a car
Summary
The TV is dying
It is hard to compete with the Internet
Nowadays , only national or international broadcast groups can broadcast the match
Perhaps political reasons contribute to the maintenance of such a significant budget deficit
However , the fact is that there is a countdown on them
Dear Mrs
I am writing to express my interest in the position advertised in your newspaper , having seen the details and believing my skills and experience make me a strong candidate
I would like to join your small group on a trip around the world
I am a 20-year-old student from Switzerland , speaking German , French , and English , and I am keen on traveling
Having made several trips to many countries until now , I would say that I have already gained some experience in travelling around the world
I am interested in joining your group because I like meeting new people from other countries , and I would like to explore new countries around the world
For ten years , I have been in a scout group , in which I have learned a lot about different skills to find my way or orient myself in the wilderness
Furthermore , I believe I would be a good fit for your group because I like travelling and I would like to be a part of your adventure
I look forward to hearing from you
Dear Steve
It was good to hear from you
Basically , my idea is to use this trip to learn as much as possible , not only the English language , but also to learn more about the culture and visit nice places in the country
As I told you before , I ca n't afford to pay this trip alone , so my father will put up some money to help me
But I want to find a job to help him with the bills
Can you give me a hand with it ?
You can also help me find a cheap place to rent ?
It will be helpful if you find a small apartment near Cambridge University where I 'll study English for 5 months
Thanks for all your help , and I look forward to hearing from you
I send you my best wishes
João Matos
Hi John
I am looking forward to seeing you
First of all , you should get outside the airport terminal
There , you will see some bus stations on the street
When you get there , take the bus , which has number 111
Go to the bus stop `` Zličín ''
There , you can get to the underground station , and travel to the centre of Prague
If you choose this way , I 'll call you in the morning to tell you where we will meet exactly
But if I were you , I would take a taxi because the underground is quite boring , but it is cheaper
Anyway , you need to get to the centre
Finally , the weather forecast for next month looks pleasant as is usual at this time of year
That 's why you do n't have to take warm clothes
I am delighted to see you soon !
Best wishes
Jacob
In my opinion , we should go to the restaurant because everyone needs a relaxing moment to do their work better than before
Firstly , we can discuss the type of food we want to eat
Actually , students eat a lot of fast food while they are studying at university , because they do not have time to cook food
On the other hand , we are studying architecture , so maybe we should choose a special restaurant
In conclusion , I think that this type of food and atmosphere is very suitable for us , because normally we speak about books , work , and studies , whereas in this type of environment we can speak about ourselves , our families , our hobbies , and everyone gets to know new things about each other
I would like to go to Foster 's Hollywood
I love the food here , and I think my classmates do too
You can eat the best burgers you have ever eaten
They are incredibly delicious
I do not know how they make and cook them
These burgers are my favorite food because they are amazing
I can not say how they are , because you have to taste them
It is a feeling similar to staying in heaven or in paradise
I recommend that you go to this restaurant and you will definitely leave with a very good flavour in your mouth and a huge smile on your face
You will want to come another time
However , if you do not like burgers , you can eat any other American food you like , and you will receive the same fantastic treatment as a person who has eaten a different meal
Public transport plays an important role in our modern-day lives
More than a billion people use buses , taxis , and trains , among other modes of transportation , for various purposes such as tourism , work , meeting relatives , and going to school
Many people even use cars
Although travelling by car is more convenient , it is expensive
That 's why the cost of petrol , diesel , and gas is quite high in most countries around the world
While travelling by public transport can save a lot of money in the following ways :
People can save the money they spend on petrol
The answer is 2
As they have specific routes across the country , in towns , cities , and villages , it helps people spend less at shops or restaurants , whether on highways or inside cities
I disagree with the statement stated above because in the future we are likely to have only two classes in society , the rich and the poor
The middle class is disappearing day by day
It is because of high taxes on goods that prices are increasing
So , I believe we will either have public transport or people will revert to primitive modes of transportation , similar to those used in the stone age
Public transport is even better for our environment than cars
Nowadays , people have different views about reading books and watching movies
Some of them think that books are more interesting than their film versions
I agree with this point of view
I think that there is nothing better than reading a book , or more idiomatically , I think that there is nothing better than doing anything else
Firstly , reading helps to become a well-educated person and provides an opportunity to develop knowledge
That 's why , while you are reading , you receive a piece of information
Furthermore , books develop the imagination of the reader
When you are reading , a picture of what is happening appears in your mind
You can imagine how heroes look like , you can imagine different settings where the action unfolds
And finally I think it 's very important that you can easily take your book with you and start reading anytime you want
On the other hand , if you like being in the company of others , the best way for you is the movies
You should watch it because you can watch it with your friends
Many people also choose movies because they like the soundtracks and special effects
It 's so exciting
But all these factors are not important to me
I suppose that books are better than those film versions
To sum up , I 'd like to say reading is a really great thing
A girl was walking home one day
She was with her mum
She was just a young , beautiful girl
So , they were going home when the girl noticed a cute doll in a shop
She had blond hair and she was wearing a blue dress , white gloves , and black shoes
Just like her
Her mum could n't deny her , so she bought it
Oh ! The girl had so many special moments with her doll
After several years , the girl decided that she had to move
She was eighteen years old ; she had to be independent
So she took a deep breath and put her doll in the attic , where she had stored many of her childhood memories
At night , she heard some creepy noises coming from there
She went there and there was the doll with a knife in her hand
Just because I do n't have one of my gloves ? `` But you did it again , '' she screamed
And then something happened
The next day , she went to her home , where her mum wanted to see her
So she went upstairs
The girl had a knife in her neck , and on the wall there was a sentence : `` Why did you leave me that way ? ''
Tennis is an individual sport
All you have to do is deal with the game
You can choose from many places to play
You need a good pair of shoes , a tennis racket , and some balls , and someone to play with
Although you should be good at playing backhand or forehand , you can still lose in the end
This sport is not just about physical power
You are supposed to use your brain as well
It is a combination of a physical power , a technique , and a mental power
Like other sports , tennis is getting more modern , fast , and commercial
I like professional tennis
Some children wanted to play tennis for money or glory
Some of them practice tennis because of their parents
It is not fair enough
Children should play games , not just tennis , because it is fun , and it develops their skills , helps their physical health , and provides many other benefits
You can start if you are an adult
It is never too late
You can either find a professional coach or join your friends
Enjoy yourself !

`` The student goes to the library to write their essay
In today 's essay , I am going to focus on the pros and cons of studying English abroad
Is it really worth leaving your own country for a period of time to study English ?
It is true that going abroad can open up new points of view about your own learning
Talking with English native speakers is always a good thing , because you will be able to judge how well or badly you are speaking English
Besides , it can be funny and enjoyable if you plan it properly
However , you will have to spend a considerable amount of money on it , and you can not be assured of achieving your goals at all , so it could become a real nightmare if you do not focus on your learning tasks
In my opinion , I think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages , especially if you have some money saved for this purpose
But if you do not know , there is always a solution : using the Internet to learn everything you need
You can even talk with native speakers by using online chat rooms , such as Skype and other similar platforms
Football is a passion
When I was little , I tried a lot of sports , including Handball , Swimming , and Tennis , but my favourite sport is not one of those ; it is a sport that I had never imagined : Football
All my life , I thought football was a sport for men , not for girls , but once I tried it , I loved it
Have you ever thought about playing football ?
At first , when I started to play football , I did it with my classmates , who were all boys , so I used to feel a little bit uncomfortable ; however , some years ago , they started to integrate me when they played , and nowadays , I love playing football with them
Now , some women and I started to organize female matches , so I am more used to playing with girls
I think football is a very exciting sport , and that everybody in the world should try it at least once in their life
One thing you should keep in mind if you want to play football is that you have to be ready to receive some punches
I recommend a great restaurant , which is in the shopping center , to you
I have been there twice , and I like it
Its name is `` The English Oven '' , and it 's a fantastic traditional and modern restaurant with British food
The service is excellent and the waiters are so pleasant and gentle
The interior is big , so the whole class could stay inside without any problems
The decoration is modern and cozy , and it has some great traditional British objects
The food is one of the best offerings in the restaurant , and it is always tasty and fresh
They 've got a lot of different dishes , traditional and modern
They also have a lot of different types of salads , pasta , and pizzas
The desserts are very good too
They 've got original pizzas , like sweet pizza , and traditional ones
There is a wide variety of ice creams
This restaurant is not too expensive , which is perfect for us , because we do n't want to spend too much money
The restaurant is in the shopping center , so , we can get there by bus or by train
I think this is the best restaurant to go to at the end of the course , so we could book some tables as soon as possible because a lot of people usually go there
Throughout their whole life , famous people , such as politicians and film stars , are accompanied by the media
In my view , public figures deserve to have their private lives without being photographed
On the one hand , becoming a public person associated with journalists and mass media often involves dealing with camera flashes
Famous people have an obligation to live their lives in an exemplary way
However , as they are ordinary people , they make mistakes
People are thought to be jealous
Notice any failures
It seems to me that journalists might be absolutely toxic and they have a defective influence on society , which assesses celebrities through the prism of journalistic standards
On the other hand , many stars sold their privacy to earn more and more money
The value of their talents and abilities are counted in the amount of tabloid scandals
Summing up , there are famous people all over the world who do not bring their lives into the limelight
It has always been very useful for a long time ; however , today , there are some people who ask whether suppressing public transport would save society a lot of money
However , people should think about the significant advantages , such as saving money , being very comfortable , and being good for the environment
Firstly , the main reason is the cost , because people who do not have a car need to travel or commute to another place , and owning a car is very expensive
The cars need to be repaired
In addition , these people need to have public transport to travel around the country and within cities
Secondly , another reason is global warming due to high levels of pollution in the atmosphere
If you use public transport , you can be less polluting than before because there are many people who travel together on a single vehicle
Finally , the last reason is the convenience of having a car
In some cities , cars can not be parked in some places , such as the old city and the city centre
In summary , people are aware of global warming and , as a result , are considering the high costs associated with car ownership
From my point of view , I have gotten used to walking around my city , but my car is only used if I travel around the country
We are living in an ever-changing world
Today 's new things become things of the past in a few months
Take , for example , your latest handset with the latest configurations , which becomes outdated within a few months after buying it
50 years are a very long time and people 's lives will definitely change in such a long period
However , the important point to discuss would be whether it would be a positive or negative change
Over the last 50 years , science and technology have taken great leaps ; the internet and mobiles have made us more connected
Today , we have all the information at our fingertips
Today , we do n't need to worry about getting lost in a new place , Google Maps is always there to help
We do n't need to cram English words today , as we can quickly find the meaning of any word on our mobiles
Meeting new people or selling your products , you do n't need to face anyone ; everything can be managed through virtual platforms
Today our lives have become much more comfortable than in the past , thanks to the progress mankind has made in technology
On the other hand , terrorism , global warming , and greed are among the top challenges facing today 's world
Climate change due to global warming causes natural disasters now and then
Terrorist activities are causing havoc in the public life
Corruption and greed of people in power are making it difficult to trust in political leaders
If these challenges are not addressed in the coming years , imagining better lives for people in 50 years is rather difficult
We need to remember that technology is just a tool
to whom it may concern
I am an Italian girl who is studying to improve my English
I read your advertisement on your website and I immediately thought , `` That 's for me ; I 'm the right person for this kind of job ! ''
Perhaps you 're wondering why I should be the right person
That 's easier said
I 'm a motivated , flexible , and open-minded person , and I have a lot of experience in this field as well
I 've worked as a social trainer and as an educator since the age of 16
I love doing social activities and planning events
When I worked as an educator , I used to plan and manage some sports and outdoor activities
I have many great memories of these experiences and I would really like to relive them again
If you are interested , please have a look at my CV
As you requested , I attach it to this email
Best regards
To me , mobile phones are very important in my daily life
I need the device near me because I have three children and I want to know how they are and where they are
Similarly , my parents are old and sometimes they call me to talk about their health
Concerning video games , I agree with scientists that they think it helps children 's brains to develop , but it is important to control them because there are a lot of violent games
However , there are brilliant games for children
In my opinion , the Internet is absolutely a revolution in current society
It is very common to use the Internet in my work for research , to search for information , and also to connect with other teachers to discuss courses and share information
Finally , I think technological developments will improve our future
Friends should be like a shadow , always by your side
In the time of joy and sorrow , we find strength
Nothing is impossible in life , but it is not easy to find sincere friends
It does n't mean you 'll never find any
It is very important to interact and socialize with people , to make friends
The more people you meet , the easier it will become for you to find a friend
When you find someone , spend time with them , share your views and ideas , and go out with them
Friends do not have to agree on everything you say , but they should share their views about what you say
The Guardian is a British daily newspaper , which includes national and international news
You could find a variety of articles such as politics , business and money , sports , culture , education , life and style , travels , the weather , and environment
There are plenty of advertisements for jobs and donations to help the individuals
Readers are able to express their opinion freely
They use high-quality English , avoiding slang
As a result , it is suitable for students who are learning English to improve their English
On the other hand , I realised there were two disadvantages
For example , it is not suitable for children due to the language used
Overall , The Guardian is considered one of the best newspapers in the world
Nowadays , in the modern and progressive world , people are smart and the economy is highly developed
Some people think that we need tablet computers instead of books
In my opinion , the problem is very interesting
Sometimes , then , I am watching TV or reading the newspaper , and I notice that gadgets have become very useful in our lives
It also makes us more clever
I am convinced that using tablet computers in everyday life is rather beneficial
People do not need to carry a lot of books in a bag
Some people think that it is a bad idea
They believe that it is a useless thing for our generation
Such people are sure that electronic devices make us stupid
They insist on not using tablets at school
Personally , I like books very much
I do not agree with the people who think that tablets are useless
We should use it , but we must not forget about books
In conclusion , I want to say that we should keep abreast of new technologies and try to make our lives easier
The Big Mistake
This day was full of joy and happiness , but something went wrong when she told him that she was pregnant
She was so happy about this news and she thought that he would be happy as well
When she told him that she was pregnant , he just froze
It was too much for him
He thought it was easier to walk away and avoid the conversation with her
He tried to understand what 's going on with him
It was weird how many questions and doubts arose in his head
One part of him was really happy because being a father is one of his biggest dreams , but on the other hand , he could n't handle this news
This woman , who is standing next to him , is both his girlfriend and his future wife
He should be happy , hug her , and celebrate this good news
But somehow he did n't feel anything
All that he felt was anxiety
He could n't handle the feeling when she tried to touch , kiss , and hug him
He knew that she loved him as much as he loved her , but everything was just too wrong at this moment
Her voice , her smile , and even her body were all wrong at this moment
She could n't understand what 's going on , because it was just three weeks ago , when they had a conversation about kids and family , and he said that he would like to have kids with her
And now , he just avoids her
It was a big mess
She was overjoyed , and he could n't handle the news that she was so happy
They both knew that they loved each other and cared about each other , but this realization was too much for him
He stood up and said to his girlfriend that he needs a break and he has to be alone
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake
At the beginning , I am going to talk about my favorite sports and why I enjoy these sports
In fact , I do not like to do some sports at any time , but if I really need to do some exercises , I like to go swimming in the swimming pool
Firstly , I think the swimming pool is being cleared
After swimming , I have access to a bathroom to take a shower
Secondly , I do not like to go to the beach , this is because I do not like the hot sun and the sand
Thirdly , swimming in the ocean is the most dangerous
However , I like to stay in the swimming pool during the summer
Actually , I do not know how to swim , but swimming is my favorite sport of all time
Moreover , I think before playing any kind of sport , we should do some exercises because we need to warm up and relax our muscles first
In conclusion , in my opinion , I do not like doing any sports ; however , it is necessary to choose a sport to participate in , as almost everyone needs to engage in some form of physical activity , since we can not stay at home or work all the time
Even if you really do not like exercising , you can still go shopping
The purpose of this report is to outline the most important actions taken in our town to protect the environment , the main issue affecting our quality of life
In the first place , we need to pay attention to the fact that Caceres is located in a rural area where local farmers have been breeding sheep , cows , and pigs for centuries
As a result , our water resources are difficult to preserve , and it is clearly necessary to maintain active campaigns to raise people 's awareness about the importance of rational use of water resources
The local government is also taking strong action on creating green areas in different places within and around the town , where citizens can spend their free time , or even do sports
That is the reason why the city has been working on the restoration of some areas , which are now parks or recreational areas
Finally , the town has also improved the management and treatment of the waste system with the active cooperation of most of the citizens who are really concerned about waste recycling
In fact , around 90 % of Caceres inhabitants are said to sort out and recycle their rubbish , putting it in the corresponding yellow , green , and blue containers on every street
And one negative point is that the dumpsters are too visible in the town , and it would be advisable to replace them with underground ones
I woke up today and I just remembered that I did a presentation about landscapes , and those who did it would be rewarded with a bonus point , but anyway , this is n't important information
I searched for my family in the house , but there was no one there , just me
I get a bit scared , so I look for them outside in the streets
I did n't know that a bomb hit the city and killed almost everyone , so now I have to find my parents
I think the reason I did n't know about the explosion is that the area where I live is very poor and not particularly beautiful , so you ca n't distinguish where the explosion hit
After several days , I found some neighbors who had some food ; I was starving to death , so I ate a lot
We had discussions about laws , but this led to a total conflict
I think that someone takes some of the food at night while everybody is sleeping
So everybody is going to try to enforce the laws
The next morning , I ate a piece of steak while the group was talking about some creatures that were trying to kill and eat us
At night , I was thinking about many things when I heard some noises
I stalked him , and it seemed that this guy had a hump
I stomped on him , but when he turned around , I saw it was a woman from the group
We were talking about this when a dog came near
He bit my leg , and it hurt a lot
We saw the beast eating our friends and the food
The way she robbed the food at night , and when I woke up , I found that it was good for my survival
But if I had the opportunity to reverse the trend of the way I am going , I would not do it because I would have to go through all of this
Doing exercise is good for your health
Why do you have to exercise ?
What benefits do you obtain from exercising ?
Do you know that 75 % of people in Mexico do n't practice any type of exercise ? This poses a significant problem to our society and is the number one reason why Mexico has one of the highest obesity rates in the world
Doing exercise is an important thing to do in a healthy and happy life , while you exercise , you feel well about yourself and your body
There are a lot of benefits that come with doing exercise , such as reducing and taking control of your weight ; it helps you with heart disease and problems with your body , and you can also make many friends while doing exercise
Nowadays , there 's a lot of different types of exercise ; you can practice any sport , such as soccer , basketball , or baseball , or you can simply go to the gym or practice CrossFit
Soccer is a great sport where you can make a lot of friends
I recommend that you practice any sport you like and enjoy every second you spend exercising
Thank you , and start now - you wo n't regret it
Is there any future to public transport , or is travelling by car much more convenient ?
Many people disagree about public transportation , which are disappearing , although there are differing opinions on the increase in travel
This composition will explain the two different opinions
Firstly , the car is more convenient because it offers privacy
Unlike public transportation , such as buses and subways , you have much more comfort and speed
There is a perception that a car can give you freedom of choice
On the website of The Scottish Government ( publication `` Young people and transport '' ) , a 12- to 14-year-old boy explains , ' I prefer going in the car , it 's quicker
There are n't as many people around you
Although there are many positive points about private cars , there are also negative ones
Indeed , cars increase pollution ; additionally , you have traffic congestion , and owning a car is very expensive
Owning a car involves more than just possession ; it also entails looking after the vehicle , including arranging insurance , paying tax , and other expenses
Obviously it would benefit me if I worked in Edinburgh , but I do n't work in Edinburgh
A 17- to 22-year-old boy says
Travelling by public transport is not only cheaper , as we do n't pay any fees , but it is also safer
According to The Saigon Times , there have been a lot of traffic accidents involving private cars
The main reason is that the cars ' owners are drunk when driving
It is clear that if they took a bus or a taxi when they were drunk , there would have been fewer accidents
Finally , many developed countries in the world , such as England , America , Canada , Japan , and others , have built a public transport system , so the traffic jam has been decreased
As a result , the economy has increased
From this analysis , it is obvious that traveling by public transport is very important
The topic is Artificial Intelligence
Do you agree or disagree , `` Always telling the truth is considered the most important thing in a relationship '' ?
In my opinion , disagreement about always telling the truth is the most important point in a relationship
Even though being truthful is crucial in a relationship , always telling the truth can hurt others ' feelings and is therefore unwise
Another reason for not telling the truth all the time is if it is a personal matter and it would feel awkward to mention to a colleague or employer
It is better to tell a little white lie at this moment
To further illustrate the first point above , one can hurt someone 's feelings by telling the truth all the time
For example , if a woman you are acquainted with wears inappropriate clothes that do not fit the occasion
People usually tend not to tell her the truth since it could hurt her feelings
Instead of criticizing her , people may praise her for other things about her
In that case , they could still make concessions without spoiling her mood
The other point is that regarding personal matters , people usually intend to keep them private , as it is often considered strange and inappropriate to talk too much about oneself to people at work or even to people one has just met
If there are questions about things that one does not want other people to know , they might say a little white lie , which usually does not matter too much
If I had a day off to go to a doctor , I would prefer other people not to ask me details about it by saying that I just had some errands to run
These are my two opinions on telling the truth or not
Last Friday , Michael and I were in the school playing happily with each other in the classroom
When we were in the class , suddenly Michael walked towards the door
Michael closed the door and knew then that he had made a mistake
Because of this , we are both called to meet the headmaster
I could n't understand why we needed to meet the headmaster just because Michael had closed the door
The door was n't broken into pieces nor did it fall down
My curiosity put me into big trouble
I asked the headmaster in a polite way , and I hope he will give me the answer I wanted
However , things did not happen as I had hoped
I ended up getting expelled from the school because the teacher and my classmates suspected that Michael and I had stolen our classmate Sally 's wallet
I could n't imagine the teacher and friends pointing at us firmly without giving us a chance to speak out
I finally realised that everything was a trap and we were the unlucky and innocent ones as we fell into the trap
We wiped off our tears and waved our hands when we left the school
Although the headmaster found out the truth through CCTV one day later , we still refused to return to the school and decided to change to a new school , because we knew that even if we went back this time , similar cases could happen next time
The situation exists because the teacher has a biased mindset
Dear USA Summer Camps Directors ,
My name is Bianca Padovesi
I consider myself the right person for this job because , firstly , I speak English fluently and clearly , which is very important for communication
Also , I have a good relationship with young children ; I used to look after my nieces and nephews over the weekends , and they love spending time with me
Furthermore , I am very creative , which is one of my good qualities , as I can invent new and entertaining games for the kids and they can have a great time
I like making puzzles or games that involve running and jumping , which are important for children 's development
I am not very good at cooking , but because I never have the time to dedicate to it
I think that if I watch and learn how to do it , I would learn very fast and would be able to dominate it
One of my good qualities is that I learn things very fast and I also can get used to new things
I am very excited about this job and I hope you reply soon
Bianca
Day number 8
We were ready to go and find the others
We started our journey and went into the forest , where there were a lot of pests on our way
I thought that maybe my genes were actually immune to the infection ; I could actually be the revolutionary guy that helps everyone who was skeptical of me
We needed to find the ones who were still alive , or at least to learn what had happened to everyone
We found a pharmacy and a restroom where we could rest and take a shower to clean up
We got close to the pharmacy
In my area , there are many railway lines , and they are often overcrowded
But private traffic in this town is even more prevalent , since Turin is the town of FIAT , the well-known factory
Near your home , there are many supermarkets where you can easily buy everything you need to live
When you have to pay your telephone and energy bills , you can do that at a newsstand or a convenience store near your home
If you like shopping , there are some big supermarkets on the outskirts of the town that hold many items from the main factories of Europe and beyond
In all industrialized countries , a connection to the Internet is granted in almost every area and building
At the end , the taxi service is present and it covers the entire town , but this service is less organized and developed than the English one
There is an opinion that famous people , such as celebrities , film stars , politicians , or people who work in the music industry , deserve to have a private life and not be under constant observation
In my opinion , there should be a boundary between paparazzi work and the privacy of famous people
In my opinion , big stars should be able to relax and have some private time
As far as I 'm concerned , there is no one who feels comfortable when they are under the surveillance of people who wait to take pictures that show them in an embarrassing situation
Unfortunately , this is a part of a celebrity 's work , so they have to take it into account
But , on the other hand , there should be some spheres of life that are inviolable , without journalists constantly following them
These rare fragments of life , without the eye of a camera , should be an opportunity to live like normal people , not like famous people
I know that catching a celebrity doing cleaning or taking a dog for a walk is shocking news for people who read tabloids
To my mind , they do not believe celebrities are as normal as everyone else , only with more money in their bank accounts
As you can see , I agree with the statement that famous people , who are recognizable , deserve to have a private life and should also be given the ability to have a normal life
The Maze Runner
I recently watched this new film based on one of the books by this world-renowned author
As I have an interest in thrillers , I decided to give it a try
The poster of the film already offered a sense of intrigue and mystery , which made me make the decision to watch this film
The film starts by putting the viewer in the perspective of the main character , who is a 16-year-old boy who finds himself imprisoned in a cage and being transported to what seems to be a camp
He has no idea how he ended up there
However , he soon realizes that this is not a normal camp , located next to a giant , mysterious maze
The people who live in the camp take up different roles in order to survive and defend themselves against the dangers of the maze
He took the role of a runner , the person responsible for exploring the maze and looking for an exit
Still , they only have daylight to explore the maze , as when the sun goes down , the maze becomes very dangerous
The film keeps getting better and better as you watch it , having its exciting moments when the characters discover something hidden inside the maze
I heartily recommend it to anyone who wants to have a rush of adrenaline while enjoying a solid story which will leave no one indifferent
I 've been playing volleyball for 12 years now , and I hope to play for many more years
I love the speed of volleyball ; most of the time , it 's quick , and if you blink , you probably miss something
Personally , winning such a set makes me feel like I could do anything , but when I do n't , it still makes me want more
I am always trying to jump higher , hit harder , pass and set better , and serve in different ways
I live in New Eltham
My area is very clean and green
People are very friendly and helpful
It is a good place to live
Once a week on Wednesday , rubbish is taken
Of course , garbage is sorted into different bins
That is a very good idea , because that rubbish undergoes recycling
All my neighbors collected garbage
Everybody cares about cleanliness in front of the house and in the garden
Spring , especially , has a lot of colors and pleasant odors
New Eltham has beautiful parks where you can relax from the busy city
Green spaces in my town are really fantastic
I have recently eaten at Black Bear restaurant , a typical Sicilian restaurant in Trecastagni , a little town near Catania located under the slopes of the Etna volcano , and I found it to be easily the best I have eaten at
There were two rooms : a smoking room and a non-smoking room
The surroundings were rustic , yet they still felt airy and cosy
As I was eating with my friend Moreno and his father , I managed to sample a good range of items on the menu , and I really liked the Chianina beef ; it was very tasty
All the ingredients were clearly fresh and of the highest quality
The price was not reasonable at all because the meal came to about forty euros per person , thus this restaurant is a little expensive
But I would highly recommend this restaurant , despite the fact that the meal was a little expensive
Drugs are a topic with a lot of controversy
They have always been present in our societies
Cannabis , heroin , and speed are some examples of substances that are really well-known to all of us
The legalization of drugs is a commonly argued point by those who believe this measure could help alleviate the issue of social exclusion associated with drug use
Marginalization is associated with the illegality of certain activities
Moreover , this illegality is to blame for the appeal of drugs because most people start using drugs when they are young and the prohibition is very stimulating
The real problem comes when this entertainment becomes an addiction that can destroy our lives
I think everyone has tried some kind of illegal drug to have fun , enjoy time with friends or just to prove themselves , and I do not believe that behavior is wrong because everyone needs to have new experiences
But we have to be responsible and be very clear that it is only something exceptional and not part of our daily life , because it is very dangerous since some people are not able to set deadlines for themselves
Finally , the legalization of drugs means that they could be taxable
Hi Shrooq !
That sounds great
But unfortunately , I have an exam on Thursday , so I ca n't meet you , but you can pick me up from school at 1:30 and then we can have lunch
My school is really easy to find
I 'm so excited to see you !
Bye for now !
Hello , Nouf
Dear Les !
Firstly , Spain is a great place for holidays in summer
At that time , it is always sunny , but depending on the region , there may be rain
If you want to see some beautiful scenery , you must go to Barcelona , where you will be able to see La Sagrada Familia , which was built by Antoni Gaudi , or visit La Alhambra in Granada , which is considered one of the most significant architectural wonders of the world
In Madrid you can visit some museums , like the Reina Sofía or El Prado
On the other hand , if you want to see some wildlife , you must visit Cabarcenos National Park in Cantabria , which is like a little safari , or Doñana National Park , which during that time you can see some migratory birds
If I were you and I had a complete summer to enjoy in Spain , I would spend one week in each place , and I would rent a car to travel between the cities
I do not recommend taking warm clothes
I hope you enjoy your summer
Adrián is present
Bart Simpson is my favorite fictional character on TV
He is the eldest son of the Simpson family
Bart is ten years old , and he is a typical American child
He has yellow skin and big eyes
Bart always wears a red T-shirt and blue shorts
The most important thing for Bart is to be the most popular student in his school ; therefore , he is always misbehaving
His parents and the school principal often punish him
Bart is an energetic and clever student , but he is also a bad student , and he hates nerds
Although he is rather naughty , he actually has a heart of gold because he helps his sister when she needs him
In the Simpson family , all the characters are very funny
A lot of magazines say The Simpsons is the best cartoon series in history , and I absolutely agree
For me , Bart is funnier than Homer , although most magazines say that Homer is the best character
It was a dreary , rainy Sunday morning
I was n't in the mood to go out anyway
Everything suggested that I wo n't get out of the house for quite a while
Suddenly , there was a heavy knock on the door
Who on Earth could that be ?
Who would have even bothered to visit me in such terrible weather ?
My concerns were answered swiftly , for the man on my threshold yelled , `` I have a letter for Mr
`` I was quite surprised , because , to be honest , I had n't received a letter for months
I opened it and quickly scanned the text
At first , I observed the letter cautiously , but then I noticed my uncle 's name in it
Although I had never met him , this letter , which contained his last will , informed me that I had inherited a significant amount of money
Fifty thousand pounds , to be precise
Exultation seized my mind instantly , but I soon began to worry : `` What will I do with this amount of money ? ''
Well , the task I have chosen is about the town where I have been staying for the last ten years
Actually , this town is located in the middle of hills and a dry riverbed
I am very much worried about the town where I am staying because nobody in this town seems to care about the rubbish they produce every day
Animals are very dirty by nature
They are very casual about the environment and cleanliness
So-called people of good nature are inactive and talkative , often gossiping about others , and they do not work towards the betterment of their own town
All the households near the public road easily throw dirty things and do n't even bother with the municipality 's orders
I see all these things during my morning walk
`` What I feel is that everyone who is staying in the town should at least keep their own front areas clean and the sides surrounding them
I am upset about it , and whenever I get a chance , I speak with others and seek their feedback , but they share the same views
People are now self-centered and very narrow-minded
Though they are becoming so-called educated , in reality , they are still uncivilized
Dear Mrs
Yesterday , I was at the Green Pepper Cafe for a meal with my colleagues , and I saw the advertisement for a job at your cafe on weekends
I am very interested in this work and believe that my employment background makes me well-suited for this position
I am a tourism student and I need to work on the weekends to pay for my studies
I have worked for one year as a waiter at the Hard Rock Cafe and for 6 months as a waiter at Barcomi 's Cafe in Berlin
So I have experience in service , customer care , and working long hours
I know how to prepare different kinds of food , such as sandwiches , fish and fries , hamburgers , Italian pasta , etc
I am also very good at dealing with people , and as a result , I have never had a formal complaint
I am fully available on weekends , as well as in summer
I speak Spanish , English and German
Please find attached a copy of my CV : which expands on my experience and achievements
I am looking forward to discussing with you the possibility of working in this position
`` I am available to do an interview at your convenience , and I look forward to speaking with you
Thank you for your time and consideration
Yours Sincerely
María Luisa Castaneda del Acuna
Nowadays public transport has become a major topic
The idea of leaving public transportation aside is widely supported in developed countries
As a matter of fact , car ownership has increased over the last decades , reducing the number of people using public transport
The possibility of traveling in their own cars is much more convenient than going by a bus full of people , or even worse , the idea of wasting time in a long queue
Nevertheless , there is another side to this reality
There are people who can not afford to have their own cars and maybe can not afford to travel by any other means of transportation beyond what is provided by the local government
There are countries where gas is so expensive that people choose to pay the bus fare rather than paying for a full tank
Similarly , people in countries with lower incomes turn to these services because it is a way to reduce their overall expenses
To conclude , the future of public transport will depend on how people use it
There will be countries where there will be no need for it , and others where they will need it as long as their economies need it
People need easy , fast and cheap solutions
In general , using a car is easier than taking a train or a bus
It 's just near your house or your office
You do n't have to go to a station on foot or suffer because of the rain or the snow
But if you are sleepy , tired , bored , or if you simply do n't like to drive , you might find it easier to take public transport
It is also more enjoyable
Is the car faster than public transport ?
It depends on various factors
The traffic can affect cars and buses to the same extent
Sometimes cars are faster than buses ; sometimes buses are faster than cars
Speed trains are always faster than cars
When speaking about money , travelling by car seems cheaper than using public transport
But if we consider all the expenses ( buying the car , paying the insurance , etc
In fact , in every aspect , there are pros and cons
What is the state of the environment and the quality of life in cities ?
Public transport is absolutely better than private transport
So , even if travelling by car can be more convenient at a personal level , public transport should be preferred by good citizens and strongly supported by governments
Sample Informal Letter for Cambridge Advanced English Examination ( Part 1 )
Dear Jan
Thank you for your letter
I am delighted to hear you are thinking about working in the summer
From my experience working at the international company that organizes music festivals , I can assure you that it will be of great use to you
I am not sure , however , that this job will meet all your requirements
In my case , the only opportunity I had for such an activity was on July 22nd , when we had a relaxing day at the festival
Fortunately , you will get the chance to practice your English skills
In my case , I had to translate many texts and also help English tourists to find their way around
However , if you are looking for additional work experience , you will probably be disappointed
All I was asked to do in the rest of the time was to take phone calls and make coffee for tourists
All in all , the experience was beneficial
I made plenty of money , so I would n't worry about having enough for a nice holiday if I were you
When you decide what to do , do not hesitate to let me know !
Take care of yourself
Favius is going to the store
The past few weeks have been really tough for Michael
This whole business started to get on his nerves
He has to deal with it , the sooner the better
For now one thing is clear as day - the one he is in love with is Malika , not Angelina
The one he dates is Angelina , not Malika ; that 's the problem
He ca n't dump Angy just like that ; they 've been friends for years
She 's not bad
And he has to put a stop to this without hurting anybody
So yes , the decision is made
He 'll break up with her
Probably even tomorrow
It all started in such an idiotic way
The door of his room was opened , and he came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist
Mike ca n't really say why they ended up having sex
That definitely was not the right thing to do
At the moment he did n't realise that
Only after Angelina left , Michael closed the door , and then he knew he had made a huge mistake
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing to apply for the post of a summer camp counselor currently advertised on your website
`` At the moment I passed the second year of secondary school and I am waiting for the beginning of my final year '' or , in a more natural and idiomatic way , `` I have just finished my second year of secondary school and I am waiting for the start of my final year
I hope I will gain valuable experience from this job , which will be very useful in the future
As a counselor , I find it very handy to speak English , German , and Polish
I am used to dealing with young people , because last year I worked at a scout camp
Moreover , I used to work as a volunteer while I was still in primary school - once a week I would go to a local club to help children with their homework
I am hardworking , reliable and well-organised , and I can take control of difficult situations
I am an accomplished sportswoman , being a strong swimmer and a qualified lifeguard
I attach a reference from Tomasz Jaworski , who was my boss at the scout camp
I would appreciate an opportunity to discuss my suitability for this post in an interview
I look forward to hearing from you
Yours faithfully
XYZ
Well , I would like to talk about my school life
I 'm seventeen years old and I 'm an electronics student from northern Italy
I wish to be a great engineer one day , so I 've decided to continue my studies at university
I 'm good at school ; my marks could prove it
These days , I have been studying English in particular because it is the most important language in the world , so that I can communicate well with people from other countries
School is my life ; I study for about seven hours a day , especially math and electronics , which are the subjects I like the most
My teachers are very good at their job , so I hope to be like them one day
The big problem in my class is the majority of my classmates , who are not paying attention at school and waste time doing nothing , and I think they also do this at home
The thing that annoys me the most is that they copy from me and the other good students all the time
However , I do n't hate them at all ; they are very funny and kind people when they want to be
Coming back to my dream , I would like to carry on with my studies in London at Imperial College London
I hope to improve my English to a good level
Puerquitour : A great experience for your mouth
Nowadays , it is difficult to find people who enjoy food as much as I do , because they are concerned about the calories and the weight they will gain
I arrived at Mexico City one month ago , and I met an old friend from high school , Vicente
We discovered our fascination with food , and The Puerquitour was born
A brainstorming session about meals and places to visit then began
The first day started on an important date : Taco Day !
Tacontento was the place we chose , and we really enjoyed alambre al pastor and grilled onions , accompanied by cold beers
Puerquitour is something to share ; on the second day , we shared it with Diana , one of my friends from Vancouver
Again , we ate tacos , but this time they were special
The name of the place is Tacos La Chule , and they serve gourmet tacos there
It means that they have different types of tortillas - vanilla , strawberry , chipotle , nopal , and walnut , among others - and salsas - tamarind , guava , mango , guacamole , and more
The day did n't end with the tacos
The third day was one of my favorites , the place is extremely nice , and the decoration and even the attire of the waitresses makes you feel like you 're in the 50s
La Papa Guapa , which is located in La Condesa , offers baked potatoes named after famous women and lovely drinks
Highly recommended !
Mar Azul Restaurant , north of Mexico City , was the venue for the fourth day of Puerquitour
Seafood is delicious there
On the fifth day , it was time to eat more tacos
You have to be starving to eat a molcajete by yourself
Do n't forget to ask for a liter of beer
It has been almost a week since I arrived in Puebla for the tour
The sixth day was to celebrate Magda 's final test , a friend from high school who has already completed it to obtain her Master 's degree ; and to bid farewell to Vicente , who is already in the USA , while I will be heading to the UK
Because we like the food , we celebrated by eating at Memelas Pub
You ca n't go there and do n't eat the memelas ; that 's like a huarache but bigger and very delicious
The dessert
Ice cream is in Tepoznieves
Because Vic was about to leave for the USA , we spent the day together
On the seventh day , we started with a really nice breakfast , gourmet sandwiches , and rose petal tea
Then we went to a book fair and visited some bookstores downtown
The plan was to have dinner at Hilaria Gastrobar for all the good comments about it ; however , that day it was closed
The last day of The Puerquitour was spent with a visit to Starbucks to enjoy my favourite dessert , a strawberry cheesecake , and a long conversation that covered a wide range of topics
I love to spend time doing what I like , and with people I love
Do n't forget to practise and enjoy Puerquitour !
`` These first two chapters , extracted from Great Expectations by Charles Dickens , introduce a young boy known as Pip
This kid has been raised by his sister , a person who mistreats Pip and her own husband
Sadly , Pip has no fortune in any way
Moreover , he is just a regular kid with a terrible life
Besides this , Pip seems to be a shy and intelligent kid
He does not use complex words when he talks , but he uses them when he narrates
Also , his life would be the perfect inspiration for creating a dark comedy based on the undesirable life of a kid who only feels comfortable when he visits the tombstones of his parents
Obviously , nobody would like their life , but I think everyone would tend to feel sad reading these chapters and , finally , feel a connection to him
At least , I feel sorry for him , and I hope his story has a happy ending
He looks like a good boy who lives in hell , and the Devil is his sister
Nevertheless , the narrator is the true protagonist and the way the actions are told allows the story to connect with the reader
Actually , the narrator is our protagonist , who is telling the story as an adult
And the author does not try to describe the protagonist with words , but with actions
The narrator did not use any description of the protagonist apart from his name
Also , the narrator mainly uses direct speech , but he only uses indirect speech on just a few occasions when referring to his own words
This exception can be read at the end of the first chapter
Apart from this , he simply writes down exactly what the characters say
The voice is in the first person and uses a subjective point of view
He only knows what he sees and he thinks about it , but he does not have any omniscient power
However , his power lies in analyzing and describing situations with a rich vocabulary , and in a reflexive way as well
Also , he describes his parents in a hilarious way , imagining his father as a square , stout , dark man with curly black hair , and he is just looking at their tombstone
These twisted and creative thoughts are spread all over the text , accompanied by even more twisted reflections , like at the end of the first chapter , when he describes the man who stole him as a man afraid of the dead bodies in the graveyard just because he saw the man hugging himself
Besides this , the characters of the novel seem to be unhappy , living a sad and boring life that pushes them to abuse the protagonist , with the exception of Joe
The narrator does not make an effort to psychologically describe the other characters ; instead , he focuses on their appearance
Actually , we only know that Mrs
The narrator describes her as a woman who has earned a reputation for being aggressive with her little brother
And we know that Joe is a good man because the protagonist describes him as mild , good-natured , sweet-tempered , easy-going , and foolish , but that is all we know about him
Additionally , the way the characters speak is in contrast to the way the narrator writes
In fact , the dialogues of each character are no longer than two sentences , with the only exception of the thief , who talks about his partner in twelve long sentences with complex structures
This kind of structure is widely used by the narrator , but the characters usually talk in short and simple sentences
`` For instance , here is an extract from the narrator at the beginning of the second chapter : ''
`` My sister , Mrs
Having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant , and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand , and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me , I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both brought up by hand
On the other hand , the dialogues are simple and short
`` Now look here , '' he said , `` the question being whether you 're to be let live
What is a file ?
`` Yes , sir
`` And do you know what waffles are ? ''
`` Yes , sir
Moreover , the narrator 's language contradicts the characters ' statements
Pip uses a rich vocabulary , using a lot of mental verbs and abstract concepts , which are usually inspired by concrete things
The points made in the first chapter are a good example
Regardless , the dialogues are written exactly as they were said
The thief said , `` Who are you with ? ''
This is written as it is said , making it more realistic
Notwithstanding , the novel is narrated by the protagonist
The events are narrated in a mysterious way , telling us what happened in a realistic storyline without the use of flashbacks
The story is narrated as it happens
`` The second chapter makes reference to the first chapter and reveals something about the thief
Also , the slow rhythm is adequate
The narrator reveals not much about himself or the other characters , but he writes about the essential things we should know in the text
The thief disappears , but the ending of the first chapter makes us feel curious about their next meeting
Therefore , I do not know how the story will end
These chapters reveal too much mystery and provide only a few concrete facts
All I know is that this story will not have a happy ending
Probably , the thief will take Pip on an unwanted adventure that will force him to grow up faster
I would like to read a story where Pip ends as he starts at the graveyard
Like another brick in the wall , or another tombstone in the graveyard
I would like to read a story about an ordinary man who died while he was learning to live
Obviously , this would be difficult as the narrator 's voice clearly comes from a person who is alive while writing
This is obvious when he refers to the fact that photography did not exist when he was a child
Consequently , reading these chapters is a pleasure , but it is difficult to tell what is going to happen , or what is more , what the author is trying to transmit
If the story has a happy ending , then the central theme could be getting over adversities
Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her
She has been waiting so long for this day to come
It was the day she was to meet her biological mother
She knew she was adopted since she was 7 years old , because her parents told her about it
She did not feel bad about it because she loves her parents very much , and she feels loved by them
After her 18th birthday , Anna felt a sudden necessity of knowing what happened to her biological mother and why she gave Anna away
After finding the adoption papers , she contacted the adoption agency
She convinced the lady at the agency to give her the name of the biological mother of her little sister , who had a disease and needed to know if her biological mother would be a match for a kidney transplant
Even though it was illegal , the lady gave her the name and contact phone number of Sara Fielding , who was her biological mother
A month passed before she had the courage to dial that number
She hesitated several times because she was afraid of her mother 's rejection
After a few seconds , a woman picked up the phone
At first , Anna did not say anything ; she could not utter a sound
But then she said , `` Hello , my name is Anna and I think you are my mother
After a few more seconds of silence , Anna heard her mother was crying and asking lots of questions
They agreed to meet the next day in the park
She was going to have so many answers to numerous questions
Anna will be able to finally close an important chapter in her life , and as a result , she knows that it is going to be a very special day
The most exciting day of my life !
Last summer I went on holiday in Sardinia , Italy , with my family
On the first day , I was very angry because my parents did n't take Ilaria , my best friend , with us
But I changed my mind when I heard on the radio that Felix Sandman , a Swedish singer , was on holiday in Sardinia near my hotel !
I loved him , and my dream was to meet him , but I knew it was impossible
Unexpectedly , on the third day , while I was swimming in the sea , I saw some people and cameras in the distance , but at the time , I thought they were just making a video
Then I realised the boy at the centre was n't a simple boy ; he was Felix !
So I went towards the crowd , and when he saw me , he smiled
I was really excited !
Then , I went to him , and he took a photo with me
He stayed there for a few hours , during which time I spent the best day of my life asking him some questions and singing along to his songs
When he left , I was sad but also really happy
This was certainly the most exciting day of my life
L'Albero , the best pizzeria west of Italy
One of my favourite restaurants , which I always crave , is L'Albero Pizzeria , located in the Huelin neighbourhood
As you enter the restaurant , you know the pizza is going to be good
The walls are covered with trophies and photographs from being named the world 's best pizza
The space is family-friendly , a perfect place to celebrate a birthday or meet friends
My only complaint is that there are too many delicious choices on the menu ; it is often difficult deciding what to order
So far I have never been disappointed
To start , you must try the Rose Wind Salad , it 's a fresh , flavorful salad that is served in a bowl made of pizza crust
As a main dish , you ca n't go wrong ordering one of their pizzas , all are made fresh to order in their authentic Italian pizza oven
Besides the great atmosphere and the delicious food , the service is friendly and efficient
The staff is very helpful in explaining the menu to customers
The prices are incredibly cheap , at around 12 euros per person for two different dishes , drinks , and dessert
I completely recommend this terrific restaurant to anyone who is passionate about great food , at an even better value
I promise you wo n't be disappointed
The best places for young people to visit in Dublin
This report looks at the best places to visit in Dublin for young people from a different country
The findings are based on a survey conducted among students at Whitehall College , as well as on my own observations as a permanent resident in the area
It seems that the majority of those surveyed are of the opinion , that the best place to visit for young people would be Temple Bar
It offers a wide variety of activities , such as museums , a cinema , a very large green garden , and many pubs
The Johnnie Fox Pub was highly recommended , as it offers an opportunity to listen to traditional music , watch dancers perform , and enjoy a nice meal in one place
The Odeon cinema offers a multiple range of movies in 2D and 3D , and it also offers a discount for students on Wednesdays
The Dublin Wax Museum was suggested by many students
Several people said that National Botanic Garden is the best place for students to meet and spend time outdoors
On the whole , there are activities to take part in and many places to visit , depending on the students ' preferences and their finances
It is true that people everywhere like watching the sports
Sport starts being admired by youth and can imprint a model of behavior on young minds
This essay will analyze both sides of the position stated above , followed by my own perspective
From one point of view , top athletes are good models to emulate for several reasons
Firstly , watching the success of such athletes , teenagers start to aspire to be like their idols and pursue careers in professional sports
This means they will want to play sports , which is essential for their health
Secondly , doing sports also teaches priceless life lessons , such as discipline and dealing with success and failure
The importance of working hard to achieve goals and practicing regularly to become good at something are also demonstrated by professional sportsmen
This is a good example to follow for youngsters
From another perspective , sometimes professional athletes are not good role models
Firstly , sport has become a business
Many sports stars are only concerned about money and fame
This can lead adolescents to believe that money and fame are the most important aspects of sports , instead of learning how to play well and enjoying the game or the thrill of competition
Secondly , there are those athletes who behave disgustingly
For example , some take drugs or cheat in order to win at any cost
It goes without saying that this kind of behavior sends the wrong message to young people
In conclusion , there are both advantages and disadvantages of professional sportsmen as good role models for young people
On balance , I am inclined to believe that professional athletes can be excellent role models for the youth , as long as they represent the positive aspects of playing sports
Dickens and the Bronte sisters use the same realistic style
They are influenced by the surroundings in which they live : Dickens by the city of London , while the Bronte sisters by the natural landscape of Yorkshire
Dickens and Charlotte Brontë often use the first-person narrator or the protagonist 's point of view
Their realism is different ; in fact , Dickens ' style is that of sentimental realism , in which he mixes pathos and comedy , featuring characters that tend to be caricatures of the vices and virtues he wishes to portray
The graph illustrates the four different sources of consumption of fish and other meat in European countries from 1979 to 2004
According to the given source , the overall consumption of fish and meat per person per week ranged from approximately 60 grams to roughly 230 grams
From the 4 sources , 3 of them showed a steady decline , except that chicken consumption had risen over the 25-year period
Only fish consumption showed little change during the period , beginning and ending at approximately the same level of 52 grams per person per week
Both lamb consumption and the category labelled beef exhibited a declining trend between 1979 and 2004
Chicken consumption was the only source of meat consumption , which showed a steady increase from 150 grams per person per week to 250 grams per person per week
Overall , it is evident from the graph that some sectors declined , others rose , and one remained steady in terms of consumption over the 25-year span
Dear Mr
My name is Dmitry Lavrov
I 'm a postdoc at the Russian Cancer Research Center
Our lab collaborates with Alexis Hervieux on his study of arpin
Recently , he has visited Moscow , and while we have been having a conversation , I mentioned that I am looking for the opportunity to work on a postdoctoral position abroad
Since my great interest is to develop my skills in microscopy and digital image analysis while working in the field of cell biology , Alexis told me to try and contact you
Our conversation with Alexis and your own publications - all support the suggestion that working in your lab will provide valuable opportunities to master methodological and research skills
Not to mention the participation , which was in a pioneering study
My own work is dedicated to the study of changes in cell-cell contacts and in the actin cytoskeleton that take place during neoplastic transformation of epithelial cells
Earlier , I had a publication in PLoS One with descriptions of dissimilarities in the organization and regulation of adherens junctions associated with different types of actin bundles in normal and transformed epithelial cells
Thereafter , I studied the accumulation of various actin-binding proteins and actin isoforms within the adherence junctions in normal and transformed cells
On the course of this investigation I have obtained some promising results which I 'm going to report on the FEBS - EMBO conference which will take place in Paris at the beginning of September
I am also preparing materials for the next publication
Yours respectfully
Dmitry Lavrov

I visited Lugo last summer and had a great time
I walked through the old city , through its beautiful squares and parks , and I visited its numerous churches , including the cathedral
There are a lot of places in Lugo worth visiting
For example , you can walk around the Roman Wall , which was declared a protected UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000 because it is the only complete Roman Wall in the world
I think Lugo is very beautiful
There are a lot of shops where tourists and visitors can buy souvenirs ; there are also many restaurants where you can eat some delicious and typical dishes , such as octopus
In Lugo , many traditional parties and festivals take place
Among the most important things I can mention are San Froilán and Arde Lucus
From the 4th to the 12th of October , Lugo holds its San Froilán Fiestas
San Froilán is a festival of the National Tourist Interest
This festival is dedicated to the city 's patron saint , and it shows the traditional Galician costumes and folklore
Another important festival in Lugo is the Arde Lucus
It is celebrated in June
During this festivity , Lugo transforms into a 3rd-century town once again
`` I recommend you visit Lugo in June because that is when Arde Lucus is celebrated
You can enjoy traditional Roman customs and Roman life in Arde Lucus
Lugo is an incredible city and it is important in the history of my country because it is full of historical places
The bigger the city , the bigger the problem
The town is the second largest urban agglomeration in the country , producing large amounts of waste daily
City X has no specific waste disposal plan , but a federal law establishes a deadline of July 1st
Despite the current challenges , there are a few plans underway to increase the green areas and revitalize the town
The city is implementing new measures to achieve the Council 's goals
The analysis will consist of evaluating the Council 's eco-friendly proposals
According to the previous statement , the amount of garbage produced between 2007 and 2010 more than doubled , with 86 % of it being discarded inadequately
This is due to the little effect of the `` Recycling Worms '' program on the disposal problem
City X incinerates hospital residues , in accordance with legal requirements , and sends 7 % of its garbage production to recycling factories
The recycling factories have a joint venture with the municipality to sort waste , which has resulted in a 20 % improvement over last year
The program represents 2 % of the employment in the city , but it needs to expand
The city has many projects , such as the `` Keep it clean , keep it beautiful '' , whose goal is to promote proper waste disposal in public areas
Another important initiative is the `` Let 's make it green '' project , which has increased the green areas within the city by 150 % over the last two years , and consists of a combination of public and private investments in the reforestation of rural and communal areas
A later crucial activity is the `` Green Communities '' , currently accounting for 38 % of the total consumption of vegetables in the metropolitan area
A comprehensive municipal waste management policy that effectively integrates the private and public sectors along with community engagement is necessary to address the existing waste management issues
The city needs a joint venture to support a viable and sustainable recycling industry
The increase of green areas represents a significant improvement in the quality of life , according to the US report of 2012 , and also meets 16 out of 20 requirements for a city of the future
Most of the `` Recycling Worms '' problem is caused by a lack of training , which can be resolved by the training programs offered in the surrounding universities
It is a good idea to take a year off between leaving school and starting university , because you can have lots of new experiences
For example , you can travel to new places
Another idea is that you can work
Moreover , sometimes people are tired when they finish school because of the exams , so they need some time to relax
You can travel to different countries if you have time
But you need to earn money if you want to travel
You can find work as a waiter or in a shop
However , some people think you should go to university immediately after you finish school because if you do n't , you forget what you have learned in school
But I think you can also learn if you travel or if you work , which is also a good idea , especially if you find a job related to what you want to study
We live in a time when everything changes quickly
A technological development makes people believe that in the future everything will look like those in science-fiction movies
We 'll be surrounded by machines and robots
We 'll have the chance to choose which planet we want to live on
What about houses ?
Will people 's homes be different or still the same ?
Imagining the future , I see everything differently
The avant-garde and futuristic house projects will be the most desirable
The houses , for example , will have the shape of a sphere or an igloo
Some of them might be turned upside down
Sometimes they will be a kind of modern art , and as such , it will be hard to describe their shape
What about interiors ?
In our service , there will be more machines and robots with artificial intelligence
They will practically do everything , clean , cook , remind us what we have to do , and also speak with us like an average human
In practice , there will be no normal furniture , just machines waiting for a command
Everything will be artificial , and uncozy
That 's how I see a future home
Glad to hear that you 've been invited to attend the final round of interviews next month !
I really hope to work with you someday
To make sure you get the position successfully , here are some useful tips and information that you might find helpful to know
At the interview , making a good impression on interviewers is of great importance
First , dress as properly as possible !
Businesslike suits and ties fit in well with the formal occasion
Wearing suitable attire comes across as effective and reliable
Second , being punctual
Interviewers have to cope with a tight schedule every day , so they are not willing to spare one more minute to wait for a candidate who 's late somehow
Thirdly , we are being prepared
As the old saying goes , well begun is half done
You 're expected to know something about our company , to ask proper questions , and to communicate effectively with interviewers
If you can learn as much as you can about our company beforehand , you will have a better chance of success in the interview
Since you 've applied for the sales assistant position in the sales department , the sales manager will be interviewing you
He started his career as an accountant , but he grew tired of dealing with numbers all day
He is willing to communicate with others and take on new challenges
He got promoted very quickly because he always came up with new ideas and facilitated the reform and development in the department
In his eyes , what counts most is the track record and the capabilities shown in the previous work experiences , so he might ask you some questions like what you achieved and how you felt about your previous job
I hope what I mention above will be of some help to you
Looking forward to hearing from you soon
Lots of Love
Iris is a name
Dear Sir or Madam
I am writing in response to your advertisement for jobs at summer camps across the USA
Since my mother tongue is English , albeit of the British variety , and I am generally deemed cheerful , energetic , and hard working , I believe I am a suitable candidate for the aforementioned position
Additionally , as a teenager , I supervised a Wolf Cub pack of eight to twelve-year-olds , and often organised sports and evening activities for them , such as treasure hunts and paper chases
Moreover , as an undergraduate , I spent my summers working in the college canteen as a kitchen helper and progressed to the position of cook
Because of all the above points , I think I am a suitable person for the job
Yours faithfully
I find it quite difficult to find an area of improvement given Andres 's outstanding overall performance
Yet , oftentimes , being overly respectful may play against him
If I had my own language school , I would first bear in mind the main goal : raising public awareness of my language school and the services it provides
Then , I would start gathering specific information about the market , including social trends , population statistics such as age , gender , and family type , as well as potential customers and competitors
By doing so , I would be able not only to identify the strengths and weaknesses of my product , which would help me enhance its quality , but also to identify customers ' needs
After that , I would make a list of target markets and devise some strategies to attract them
For instance , if my goal was to increase young people 's awareness , some strategies could be to increase my online social media presence by posting regular updates about my language school on Twitter and Facebook , or to offer discounts for siblings
Instead , if my goal was to increase adults ' awareness , advertising in local newspapers or offering intensive courses could prove successful
However , if the target markets included both young people and adults , offering discounts for family groups could be a better choice
The last step would be to recruit a staff of professional , experienced , and qualified teachers and to set an attractive and reasonable price for the services I would provide
Last but not least , I would test ideas and approaches on customers and staff to make sure that my marketing plan succeeds
And how are you ?
Have you thought about promoting your language courses , for example ?
I challenge you to think about this concept and give it a try
According to recent research , there is no doubt that natural gas drilling rigs , natural gas pipelines , and underground natural gas storage contribute to the increased wealth of local communities
People who live in areas with natural gas infrastructure earn a few to several percent more than those who live in other regions where such infrastructure does not exist
Another advantage is that developing the natural gas industry creates new jobs , which is profitable for people living in the area
The exploration and extraction of shale gas will create lots of new jobs in various branches connected to the gas industry , such as exploration , mining , production , and distribution of shale gas
We can not ignore the fact that companies which cooperate with this infrastructure will also create job vacancies
Even if companies hire engineers and specialists mostly from abroad , there will be growth in the number of job positions in gastronomy and hospitality zones , since they will need somewhere to eat and sleep
According to the development dynamics of the natural gas infrastructure , there will be constant development in the hospitality and food sectors as well
The Kosciuszko Institute conducted research that shows Poland can benefit from extracting shale gas and developing the necessary infrastructure
Greece is an amazing country , that a lot of people visit annually
When planning their vacation , a lot of tourists are faced with the dilemma of which places to visit
Choosing where to go in Greece can be hard because there are so many choices
There are some travel destinations that definitely stand out , such as Santorini
Sandy beaches , crystal clear waters and the friendly locals are not the only things that set it apart from other islands
Santorini also has a volcano which is a spectacular sight , even though exploring it can be dangerous !
Another place worth visiting in Greece is Athens
Believe it or not , Athens is one of the most beautiful cities in the world
The Parthenon , the Acropolis Museum , and the district of Monastiraki are just a few of the things that people love about Athens
Last but not least , Crete is one of the most spectacular islands in Greece
Other than having beautiful sandy beaches and being the largest island in Greece , people can visit the water sports parks there , which are extremely fun !
Summing up , Greece is a beautiful country worth visiting , although choosing where to go can be hard
The question is whether it is better to prepare for a long time before the exam or whether a few days will be enough
In my personal experience , I believe that it is much better to prepare for a long time before any exam in your life
It 's quite important to be organized in order to achieve the highest score possible in your exam
For example , one year ago , I had my final exam in surgery
I had set up a plan to study all the books that we needed to cover for the exam and review them twice
The plan required my commitment for around 12 hours of daily study for almost 3 months
Thanks to the hard work and perfect discipline , I was able to get a very high score in my Surgery finals
If I had n't had such an organized plan , I would never have gotten such a perfect score
Another thing to add is to not be stressed before the exam night
It 's quite normal to have this basic feeling of being stressed and nervous when the exams are approaching
What is not normal at all is having anxiety due to the plethora of unfinished studies that are included in your exam
For example , I once had a chemistry exam in high school , and I was foolish enough to neglect my studies , thinking that I still had enough time to ace the exam
Two days before my exam , I realized that I ran out of time
I had insomnia the night of the exam ; it was n't just that I was n't well prepared , but I was also extremely nervous , and that affected my scores tremendously
Ever since I have started doing everything on time , I am not overly stressed and I get better scores
Moreover , if I aim to get high scores , I believe that memorizing the details is important
If you do n't start studying before the exam at an appropriate time , you will only have enough time to get an overview of the subject , but this will never help you soak up the details and understand the concepts underlying every concept
That will help you a lot even if you do n't get the chance to revise everything before your exam
I recall a time when I was quite ill before my Anatomy exam , and I could only go through the main titles of each branch , without delving into the details
In the exam , I encountered a question that required me to describe a concept ; amazingly , I was able to do it perfectly , can be rephrased to : In the exam , I encountered a question that required me to describe a concept
Since I had practiced a lot and memorized the concept several times before , I remembered it
It started flooding with little effort
Definitely , having enough time to memorize and practice what you learn will help you a lot in your exam
In sum , I believe that setting a schedule to have a long-term preparation plan is much better than having only a few days to get prepared
Do n't you think you are worth getting the highest score one could aim at ?
In my opinion , nuclear energy has the best chance to replace fossil fuels
Firstly , nuclear energy is not bad for the environment
The carbon dioxide emissions are very small
The biggest threat is the explosion
However , the technology is evolving and nuclear power plants are getting safer
Secondly , nuclear power plants are already very popular , and this type of energy is the closest alternative to replacing fossil fuels
Energy that we get from the sun and wind is still only a few percent of the world 's energy production
Thirdly , only the construction of a nuclear power plant is expensive
When we have a power plant , producing energy from it is very cheap
The most expensive thing in a nuclear plant is hiring qualified personnel
Besides , we need something that can work all the time
It ca n't stop making energy when the weather is bad , because people need a lot of electricity
If we run out of power , entire cities could plunge into chaos , and this is unacceptable
Lima , the only South American capital , is located overlooking the Pacific Ocean
Lima was founded by Francisco Pizarro in 1535 as `` Ciudad de los Reyes ''
Lima has a multicultural tradition , where a complex mix of racial and ethnic groups coexist , including mestizos , European Peruvians , who are the second largest group , and minorities such as Aymara , Quechua , and Afro-Peruvians
Lima is the best example of colonization , immigration , and indigenous influences , such as the preservation of Pre-Hispanic legacy , with architectural monuments , called `` Huacas ''
The Historic Centre of Lima was declared a World Heritage Site in 1988

Lima is a beautiful city of contrast , where you can find a diversity of historical , modern , and business places
Archaeological sites , beaches , valleys , natural reserves , and the exquisite cuisine give Lima , Peru 's capital , an authentic personality
Definitely , Lima is a spectacular and charming city to spend a perfect holiday
Hi Jane !
Last time you asked me for some information about opening a savings account in the UK
Below , you can find a few suggestions of mine
The Phone Bank might give you a quite good offer
Firstly , the rate of interest is at 3
Additionally , if you open a savings account in that bank , you will get a diary as a gift
You do not need to pay any annual charges to have a credit card
Unfortunately , the bank does n't have branches in Britain
All banking operations must be conducted by phone
The second bank , Royal Savings Bank , has many branches in the UK ( over 650 ) , so you can conduct all banking operations on the spot
However , there is a service charge for having a credit card ( £12 per year )
You also get a gift as a new account holder : a full set of saucepans ; do you really need one ?
All in all , I would recommend that you open your first savings account at Phone Bank , since the rate of interest is higher and you do n't need to pay any annual charges
Doing operations by phone is actually very easy , and it always gives you a great opportunity to improve your English
The final decision is yours
Take care , see you very soon !
Yours sincerely , Agnieszka

An important thing to do !
My dear Paul
I am writing to tell you how happy I am that I was chosen to deal with the sound recording at Lady Gaga 's concert
It must have been my friend , Marius Boni , who recommended me for this service
I could n't believe my ears when the phone rang , and I answered
What can I say ?
It 's been my dream since childhood , and now I am overwhelmed when I realised they thought of me to do this for such a great and important person in the world of music
I am glad that they were satisfied with my service
I can hardly wait for you to see me and to share my happiness with you , and to tell you all about the details of this unique experience !
Yours

I have been skiing for most of my life and I am very enthusiastic about it
I started when I was six , with equipment that was very basic compared to what skiers use these days
Every day , as soon as I woke up , I looked forward to my morning on the slopes
My parents would take me to a gentle slope with my brother , and leave us there for a couple of hours to try skiing on our own
The temperature was often several degrees below zero , and you would freeze if you did n't keep moving up and down the slope
My brother showed a natural talent for the sport , but I felt quite uncomfortable and quite scared
Little by little , I improved my skiing skills , and by the time I was a teenager , I really started enjoying myself
Nowadays , I have a lot of fun skiing because it gives me the opportunity to be in a wonderful natural environment
Skiing is a great sport , but I would recommend starting as a child , taking a few lessons with an experienced instructor , and using the right equipment
After six years of rigorous high school subjects and past experiences , I am confident that the preferences I 've selected above are deliberate
I am extremely interested in gaining experience in the business field
The subjects I 've pursued at the high school level , such as financial accounting , commerce , and economics , have provided me with the opportunity to apply and understand business concepts , giving me a solid academic foundation
I 've also participated in various group projects during my time in high school
I am planning to gain admission to the university of my choice to obtain a bachelor 's degree
I would love to associate with extremely talented students , lecturers , and even professors to gain a well-rounded introduction to the numerous aspects of the preferences I have selected above
Academically , I 've always been a very determined and studious individual , and I would be more than willing to devote myself to the hard work necessary to achieve a bachelor 's degree
I also have an undeniable passion for extra-curricular activities
I was the president of the Business Students Association ( BSA ) , the Head Boy ( senior prefect ) , and the Captain of the school soccer team
I am a skilled soccer player who plays in a midfield role
Undertaking a scholarship and admission into one of the universities I have selected above will provide me with the opportunity to apply the knowledge gained in high school to a business setting , as well as develop the communication , organisation , and numeracy skills I acquired during that time
After I heard about the Czech Government Scholarship , I decided to conduct some research on the Czech Republic before taking any further steps to apply
I found out that the Czech Republic is a country with rich possibilities for students planning to study abroad and is currently undergoing rapid social changes and transformation , making it a fascinating place for students of any discipline to study in
Czech universities provide high standards of education , internationally recognized degrees , modern campuses with outstanding facilities , safe and affordable education , a warm and friendly environment , and cultural diversity
I believe that I will have the opportunity to experience both modernity and tradition in one of the safest and most stable countries in Europe
Above all , the high quality of education will make me ready for the future
Another major reason why I am motivated to study in the Czech Republic is due to a lack of finance
Also , education in Nigeria is now a joke , as teachers and lecturers go on strike frequently , and learning in some parts of Nigeria is not safe !
Right now , I am greatly looking forward to the challenges in a university life , academically , socially , and mentally , and I believe that my ambition to learn new business concepts , coupled with my passion for extracurricular activities and community service , would make me a competent addition to any of my proposed universities and a strong candidate for the Czech Republic Scholarship
I believe that I can make a positive contribution to my proposed university , as I will be actively involved in various student events and activities that will help promote a healthy learning environment for everyone
In conclusion , I can assure you that I will be a capable and dedicated student who has the commitment and dedication to work hard to graduate , while at the same time contributing greatly to my proposed university in various ways
A dog is a man 's best friend
It is a well-known fact that people need to communicate with other people
However , they are not always satisfied and are not accepted into society
They seek solace in someone with whom they would feel more comfortable
The best example is an animal with great qualities , such as a dog
Dog 's personality is one of its best qualities
Always friendly , bubbly , and in a good mood , they are great to spend time with
They feel it when their master is sad and react by cuddling up to them
It makes people forget all about their problems and concentrate on the things that really matter
A dog 's optimism is , by far , the best way to bring a smile back to people 's faces
And that is what they are there for to make people happy
These hairy four-legged animals are also very protective
One of their jobs is to watch over their human family
So if they sense that their owner might be in danger , they immediately react by barking at a person or a thing that might have caused it
The stronger the bond between the dog and its owner , the stronger the dog 's reaction will be
It is believed that dogs require a lot of attention which is not true
Dogs are really not that hard to take care of
These pets need a few walks a day , which could also be good for their owners , who spend all day at work or in school and need some physical activity
Having a dog could also remind people to live a healthier life
In conclusion , dogs make really great pets
Not only do they protect you from anything that could do you harm , but their amazing personality and the love they show you make you feel so warm and wonderful on the inside
So if someone really loves their pet , they would find time to pay a lot of attention to them , because they truly are man 's best friend
Hi , John
It 's great to hear from you again ! I will give you some details about my experience at `` Zoe Kak adventure '' , one of the most well-known centres in our country
First of all , we started with a tiring assault course , which consisted of climbing up very sharp walls and crawling through different obstacles
Although it made me feel exhausted , I found it extremely entertaining
Luckily , I was fit enough to finish the exercise without any problems ; however , you may need to train a little bit more before attempting this activity
Rock climbing was one of the challenges I had to face
Despite the fact that it turned out to be harder than I had expected , I managed to reach the summit
You ca n't imagine how rewarding the feeling is of being at the top of the mountain , after such a big effort !
Furthermore , you will be able to practise canoeing
One of the last activities offered by the centre was diving
I felt so overwhelmed that I had to give it up
To sum up , I strongly believe that you will have a great time there and I guarantee you that all the teachers follow the safety rules , so you can enjoy yourself without worrying about getting into trouble
For all these reasons , this centre is really worth a visit
Please write to me soon and let me know if there 's anything else you need
With best wishes
Sara smiles
I felt so excited when I looked at the envelope on my desk
I checked the address as quickly as I could ; I realized that I was right , it was the letter from Paris
My mother wrote to me after months
Since she left for Paris last year , I lived in the school residence , which was not cheerful at all , and this made me feel really depressed
But I had her letter at last , so I started to read it immediately
She told me that when I was on holiday , I should buy a plane ticket to Paris and visit her
It felt so good when I saw that my mother had n't forgotten me
I had never traveled to Europe before , so I was really nervous , but this trip would be a great chance to improve my French and spend a lot of time with my beloved mother in the City of Love

Education is a key milestone in life and a good education is the key to entering the labor market
Aware parents , disappointed with the educational systems and institutionalized education , try to find a solution in homeschooling for their children 's education
Although homeschooling may seem , to some parents , like a paved road , it actually presents several challenges
This path is not suitable for everybody 's cars , and that compels us to seek other routes
Homeschooling should not be considered a world-wide phenomenon since only a few countries , the UK ,
Canada and especially the USA can boast of their natural beauty
There are lots of countries that do not exist
Some countries accept homeschooling as a legal alternative , while in others , it is considered an isolated occurrence
The situation in Spain can be assessed as a legal vacuum in light of our constitutional right to free speech
Attendance is compulsory in elementary and secondary education
Educational and emotional freedom support this alternative way of learning
Homeschooling may also free up time for complementary activities such as music , sports , and family time
Homeschooled students ' success has been backed up by the results on standardized tests and the recognition of prestigious universities
Now , before homeschooling your kids , you also have to consider the same amount of roadblocks
The lack of facilities or expertise and not enough socialization for your children can lead to a situation where you end up being a frustrated parent without enough money to make ends meet
`` As far as I am concerned , I want to think about homeschooling as a wake-up call for the educational system
Systems exist
However , homeschooling will never succeed if parents do not have the right skills
As traditional education seems to be exhausted , new technologies open up as the
The solution is blended learning , which is the future
Geographic and natural environment surrounding the building , as well as the neighbourhood , will be taken into consideration when designing future houses
Obviously , the future also indicates a home with more technology and highly energy-efficient systems
In areas exposed to cataclysms , such as earthquakes , hurricanes and floods , people should have their houses built of resistant materials
Steel or concrete structures would give the desired effect in this particular matter
Environmentally friendly buildings will be on the drawing board
Built with recyclable or recycled materials , the exterior surface of these houses is designed to maximize natural light on sunny days , with features such as skylights and solar panels on the roofs , which are becoming increasingly popular
Moreover , solar energy collectors ought to be controlled by computers in order to maximize comfort and energy efficiency
Urban housing issues , such as population growth , can be addressed by developing new areas
Maybe it 's building castles in the air , but houseboats and apartments situated above the city streets seem to be a perfect solution to utilize otherwise wasted space
Although people would continue to mull over how to modernize their fancy houses and brag about it to their neighbors , they will still need a warm , cosy bed and a nice cup of tea
I suppose they will never change , even if they live in an ivory tower
Catch it or lose it
The alpha and the omega of a good team are trust
That 's the most important point if you want to play handball !
You must be able to throw the ball blindly to your teammate , and he must catch it
Otherwise , the opponent will have the chance to get a point
Are you a real team player ?
Handball is one of the most dynamic sports in the world
Over eighty points can be made altogether in sixty minutes , if not even more
This shows how rapidly the game can change
One lost ball can make your team lose the game
I started to play handball when I was 5 years old
At first , it was only a hobby but over the years it became a passion
What I love most about this sport is the speed and the unconditional team spirit
If you want to practice handball , just be sure that you have a good team and do n't forget the fun !
Triathlon , a famous sport throughout the world
It seems that , recently , society has become more conscious of the importance of practising a sport
Clearly , this is a consequence of the extra hours we have to work per day ; as a way of relaxing , we find that doing a sport is an effective way of relieving stress
In fact , we can see many people jogging and cycling these days , whether it 's in the morning before work or in the evening afterwards
Despite these two being the most popular sports amongst athletes , many more are just as interesting and profitable
One of them is triathlon , which is my favorite sport
It consists of a mixture of three different sports : swimming , cycling , and jogging , and as a result , it can be extremely demanding
What I enjoy most about it is being able to practise it anywhere , which means I can do it near home instead of having to go to a sports centre
It also means I can choose the location that pleases me the most and therefore fully enjoy the time spent doing it
Triathlon has become more popular over the past few years , and more and more people are eager to try it
Therefore , it is crucial to understand that improving in such a demanding sport requires time and it is important to establish some goals in order to stay motivated
You must not push yourself too far
A gap year between school and college sounds like a great idea for those who have not decided what they want to study
However , there are some questions about whether or not it should be for everyone
First , I would like to put forward the arguments in favour of taking a year off
Not everybody has the financial means to pay for college , so taking a gap year to earn money to help with the bills is time well spent
But it is not the only reason to take a year off
Most people think that the purpose of this year is to travel to other countries and spend all their time at parties
On the other hand , many teens who take a year off end up spending it in the wrong way
For example , things might have gone not as they had expected for multiple reasons , such as not having enough money or not getting a job
In conclusion , people should take a year off , but only when they have fully planned and know for sure that they have the possibility to do something useful with their time

`` Farmer Giles of Ham '' is a fantasy story written by J
Set in England in the early centuries of the Middle Ages , the story is about the adventures of Giles , a farmer from the village of Ham , who becomes a hero against his wishes by defeating a giant
When the dragon Chrysophylax comes and devastates everything , a hero is sent twice against him
At the end of the story , Giles becomes an independent king
I really liked this story , firstly because I love fantasy stories , especially those by Tolkien : they transport me to another universe , making me forget about my daily life
Secondly , it is very original because it parodies traditional legends in several ways : the hero is an ordinary person , knights are revealed as fearful and incompetent , and clashes are won with words instead of weapons
I would recommend this story to everybody because it is funny and adventurous , and Tolkien 's ironic style , which is based also on the comical use of Latin words , makes it extremely pleasant to read
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing this letter to apply for a position at a USA summer camp that I saw advertised in our local newspaper
I am interested in working in educational institutions or in social care
I have recently graduated from the Social Science University in Psychology and received high grades in both my teaching and supervising courses
Additionally , we were required to have one year of volunteering in a youth supervising environment in preparation for our final assignment , so I am able to be a member of your well-skilled staff
Since I was 13 years old , I have been helping my parents with raising my four younger siblings
I have been involved in volunteering as a supervisor and a tutor in a variety of youth organizations
In the past two years , I have worked in the scout organization , helping the area manager to organize activities for children
This experience has given me the ability to cope with the needs of all types of children
I have a friendly happy personality and find that I enjoy the challenges of working with youth
In addition , I have learned through my studies and experience to be accurate and efficient in organizing my work , so I would be a valuable addition to your team
I look forward to hearing from you
Yours faithfully
Lubomir Sawicki
Does travel broaden your mind ?
In my opinion , travel does broaden your mind
When you visit different places , you get to see different environments , cultures , people , and even different languages
Traveling helps you to develop as a person in many ways
For example , if you learn another language different from your own , even if it is just a few basic sentences , you can communicate with people from different regions , and this improves your confidence
Travelling also helps to see how other people live , and to realize that your way of living is not the only one that exists
This can help you understand that not everyone has access to many things you do , and to realize that perhaps you should appreciate these things , such as smartphones , computers , cars , or even fresh water , which is a basic resource , and we tend to take it for granted that everyone can have some water to drink , even though this is not true
Besides , when we travel to different places , we see many different cultures that differ greatly from our own , and we see how different humans are from one another
For all of these reasons I think travelling really broadens your mind
I want to build my career as a full-fledged researcher and academic
To fulfill this dream , a PhD degree would be the most essential step
I am particularly interested to pursue a PhD in Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
I have a plan to study the equilibrium properties of condensed-phase systems
I would also like to carry out my PhD research in the development of transition metal complexes , which can be used as drugs against several human diseases , as cosmetic materials , and as photonic and optoelectronic materials in devices
I also find Analytical Chemistry and Environmental Chemistry to be interesting fields of Chemistry , because of their numerous applications
I believe that I possess the strong motivation and intellectual capability to build a career in one of the previously mentioned fields
After completing my PhD , I will return to my country and continue my teaching as well as research at the University of Barishal
There is no future for public transport
The number of cars grows rapidly ; however , the public transport is still in use
Especially in big cities , where there are traffic jams , public transport is becoming more and more popular again
In some cities , it is even forbidden to drive through the city center without special permission , so there is no other solution than to use public transport
But what is more convenient - your own car or public transportation ?
Well , it depends
You do not have to worry about the schedule ; you are a driver , so it 's your decision whenever you want to go or stay longer in a place
You can listen to your favorite music or radio stations
You are the boss
However , as a driver , you always have to be careful and watch out for hazards on the route
If you want to travel from one place to another to visit different places , having your own car is the best solution
It allows you to see much more in your place
But think about the costs
Consider how much you pay for petrol nowadays
Consider how many days you have for vacation
Maybe cheap airlines are better
We are back to our everyday life
Most of us are living in big cities and face problems with the traffic
What if we use public transport to get to work ?
Well , then you do n't have to worry about the parking space and you can read more books on the way to work
Simply , you can use this method to create additional time for yourself
What else ?
After work , you can go for a drink with your colleagues
If ecology is important to you , just think about the impact of pollution
Let 's reflect once again : is there a future for public transport ?
In my opinion , yes , there is
Is traveling by car more convenient ?
Well , it depends !
`` Why use the first narration ? ''
The first narrative can attract readers ' attention at the beginning of the fiction and draws the readers into the thoughts of the madman easily
We ca n't understand what others think usually , but in this fiction , the author invites us to know what 's inside the madman 's mind
Feeling that the main character is talking to us , as if we were all involved in this case , the whole thing seemed as though it had really happened
Facing the murder directly makes the horror penetrate into our hearts
How does the author create a world of horror for his readers ?
The author created the horrible atmosphere by describing the scene , the disordered mind , and heartbeats
First , the scene that describes the murder makes readers ca n't help but emerge the images in their minds
Just like the madman 's plan was happening right in front of us
Then comes the sound of the heartbeats
In my opinion , heartbeat is the element that pushes the whole story to the climax
Every time the sound of heartbeats grew louder , something happened
For the first time , when the madman heard the heartbeats of the old man , he was going to kill him , and so he did
The second time the madman heard the heartbeats , he became impatient , scared , excited , and insane
At the same time , the heartbeats also made the readers nervous and anxious
Finally , I think the way the author wanted to convey the disordered mind of the madman is through his narration
The whole story , except at the end , he confessed the crime ; the madman used an extremely calm and steady intonation to describe the cruel things he had done
The sharp contrast between calmness and cruelty leaves a strong impression that the main character was completely insane
The horror inside our hearts increases , making us shiver
`` Let 's go to the forest to see the variety of animals which are found there , '' Max told his friends one sunny afternoon
When everything was set , they started their trip to the forest
When they arrived there , they started to look around trying to find different types of animals such as birds , rabbits and deer
Max and his friends took a walk under the trees when , across the river , they saw something that looked like an animal lying on the grass
They ran quickly , crossed the river , and reached the place where the animal was
When they saw the animal , they could see that it was suffering , so they decided to free it
Following this decision , Max mustered the courage to open the trap
One of Max 's friends brought water from the river to give to the deer
Max cut a piece of his T-shirt to help the animal
Afterwards , the animal was better and it walked away slowly
When the day ended , Max and his friends returned home feeling happy because they had saved the animal 's life
The question is whether it is possible to be famous without journalists
Probably not , but there are many people in show business or political life who are willing to do anything to protect their private lives
Generally , people may be famous for two reasons : because of their job or their scandalous private life
If you decide to become famous because of your scandalous private life , it would be silly to complain about relentless paparazzi
There is a rule , probably one of the most important rules in public life , that says more or less : 'It 's not important what people are saying about you , it 's important that they are talking about you '
Most celebrities follow this rule as this is what they live for
That is why they are often able to sell information about their private lives
Real problems start when journalists injure not the celebrity , but the celebrity 's friends or family
Paparazzi are cruel to the children of famous people , which may have a negative influence on their emotional development
What about those who do not want to become popular as a result of scandals ?
In most cases , they are just doing their job to the best of their ability and living a boring life
Finally , when paparazzi notice that there is nothing interesting about them , they just leave them alone
In summary , I believe that adults are responsible enough to make decisions about whether they want to share the most important parts of their lives with journalists
And I hope they understand that their duty is to save their relatives
Great food is probably one of life 's greatest pleasures
As a person who loves to eat , I consider environment , quality of food , and price as the main factors to decide where to go
Last Friday I visited a brand new Mexican restaurant in Lisbon called `` Las Ficheras ''
It was suggested by two friends of mine , who recommended it due to the good food and funny environment
I went to dinner with 6 friends in order to have fun and eat good Mexican food after a stressful week
In my opinion , the food was good , but the prices were too expensive considering the small quantity and poor service
We faced continuous problems with the order , such as dishes from another table being served to us by mistake , the drinks being served with a considerable delay , and the bill being presented prematurely - even though we had finished our dinner , our drinks were still on the table
Luckily ( or unfortunately ) , I met a friend of mine the next day , who told me that she had dinner at `` Las Ficheras '' before , and in her opinion , as a Mexican , the restaurant was terrible
She also told me that a great Mexican restaurant had just opened , with lower prices and good service
I became curious about this place and decided to visit it later
`` Pistola y Corazón Taqueria '' was the first Mexican restaurant where I could eat genuine Mexican food , and it had lower prices and great service
They served us nachos with tomato sauce for free while we were choosing the main dishes
After choosing , a bottle of fresh water was served again for free
We chose tacos with meat and guacamole sauce , and it was absolutely delicious
After paying the bill , they offered us a shot of tequila to finish our visit , confirming that great places still exist
Hey ! I survived ! : )
First of all , thank you for your time and your help with the article !
How are you ?
And also , where are you now ? : )
In my case , I am much better now
Last week I borrowed an ankle support and some crutches , and ever since then my condition has been going better
Furthermore , precisely today I have started my 15-day rehabilitation sessions !
So I should be back to jumping around in no time : )
As you know , Malta was a big punch in the stomach , which I definitely did not need
The course and the organization were disappointing
Anyway , CS and magic saved me at the last minute on my last night , and I left Malta with a smile and a warm heart
And for that I want to thank you once again
Back home , everything started happening fast - I should have gotten used to it by now , should n't I ?
So I did n't have time for much
I have been totally immersed in looking for jobs and translating a scientific paper for a former student of mine
He decided to finish the second half without my help
Sorry , I am going to utilize your native language skills once again
`` I am unsure about the differences between the phrases 'be good enough , ' 'measure up , ' 'make the grade , ' and 'be up to standard/the task
I have a whole bunch of free hours , even days , again
From Sunday to Tuesday , a period I was not counting on , proved to be wonderful !
I decided to get back home , as I had spent the whole week at my friend 's place in Madrid , which is quite close to his house , where I had gone every day the previous week , and I started getting things done
The two-day one-night trip with my mother and sister went quite well
The place we were visiting was very beautiful , and if we had n't been limited by my ankle , we would have gone for a short hike
Tomorrow I 'll be starting my first English class , which has taken much longer than I had planned
I have sent out a lot of CVs and have gone to three interviews so far
Regarding the pictures from Ramla , could you wait a bit longer ?
I have n't found time to download the pictures , as with all the things I need to sort out , it was definitely not a priority
Remind me again , you , if you see that I 'm forgetting , okay ?
Please !
Did you ask Mario about the speakers ?
Because chatting is much faster than writing
I 'm going to go now
Talk to you soon , Mike
Get a big hug from sunny Spain ( yes , finally ! ! ) or , alternatively , for a more integrated approach : Get a big hug from Spain , where the weather is finally warm !
`` Global warming and its consequences were significant in 2015
The Guardian 's article `` World 's Climate About to Enter 'Uncharted Territory ' as It Passes 1°C of Warming '' , published on 9 November 2015 , describes the problems of global warming
According to scientists at the British Met Office , 2015 is expected to be the year when the milestone of a 1°C warming will be broken , a change caused by global warming , which will lead to unknown consequences in the future
The World Meteorological Organization announced that 2015 was the hottest year on record , with average carbon dioxide levels increasing due to the burning of fossil fuels
These problems , which were just announced , will be discussed at the UN summit in Paris , in three weeks
Then , world leaders will be negotiating about cutting increasing carbon emissions and the El Niño climate phenomenon
Stephen Belcher , director of the Met Office 's Hadley Centre , claims that humanity is to blame for climate change , such as the rise in temperature and the catastrophes expected by scientists when global warming exceeds 2C
She stands up for a global deal confirmed at the UN summit by the world 's leading states and thus these climate targets should be a role model for other countries
Furthermore , climate scientist Ed Hawkins expects a continuation of global warming , as illustrated by the example of Central England , which has warmed 20 % more than the global average
Global warming leads to more natural disasters , such as flooding , heatwaves , water stress , and loss of harvests
Facing these consequences , a 4C warming would be even more damaging , according to Belcher
Despite the result of a NASA study pointing out that there would have been an increase in ice mass in Antarctica between 2003 and 2008 , there is only a 5-10 % chance that this prediction will come true , according to Prof Andrew Shepherd , University of Leeds , because the study has already been proven wrong by 57 other studies
Although the NASA study shows a different result , the majority of scientists see global warming as a dangerous threat to this planet , affecting living conditions , the environment , and the economy , and they also consider it a key issue that was discussed at the UN summit in Paris
The problem lies in the outdated framework in which the IWC operates
Fifteen whaling nations formed the IWC after whale populations collapsed
The organization was initially set up to conserve whales so that they could continue to be used by humans
The importance of World Heritage properties transcends national boundaries
Their qualities are extraordinary , so no matter in which country they are found , or whoever experiences them , they evoke a sense of wonder and admiration
To be included on the World Heritage List , properties must be of outstanding universal value and meet at least one of ten selection criteria
The World Heritage List is important because it attracts tourists , and these landmarks are cherished by everyone around the world
It is also protected by UNESCO because they have found new animals or plants , and there are endangered species in that area , which have significant historical importance
World Heritage is the designation for places on Earth that are of outstanding universal value to humanity , and as such , have been inscribed on the World Heritage List to be protected for future generations to appreciate and enjoy
The site is the property of the country on whose territory it is located ; however , protecting it is in the interest of the international community to preserve it for future generations
Its protection and preservation become a concern of the international World Heritage community as a whole
Another advantage of being inscribed on the World Heritage List is that once a country signs the Convention and has its sites recognized , the resulting prestige often helps raise awareness among citizens and governments about heritage preservation
Greater awareness leads to a general rise in the protection and conservation of heritage properties
A country may also receive financial assistance and expert advice from the World Heritage Committee , to support activities for the preservation of its sites
The disadvantages of sites not included in the World Heritage List are that these sites do not receive funding , and therefore , they can not protect them from risks
Moreover , they remain on the list of sites in danger without receiving assistance
In my opinion , sites that are in danger and do not meet all ten criteria should be protected by UNESCO
It 's difficult , but I think that it is necessary to try to invent new ways to finance and defend the natural and cultural heritage
Cricket is my passion
I love playing , watching and talking about it
It 's my first passion and I am following it as far as my earliest memory goes
Cricket is a team sport that teaches us teamwork , collaboration , and strict discipline
It also teaches us how to overcome individual weaknesses and gain an advantage from others ' strengths to succeed as a team
I have been playing cricket since my early childhood
Even when I was a kid , I started playing with boys much older than I
It gave me a lot of confidence and a chance to improve my skills rapidly
I followed cricket religiously , and I watched almost every match India played
Sachin Tendulkar is my favorite cricketer
I am a fan of his batting
He has broken almost every record in cricket history
Apart from his cricketing skills , I loved his ability to handle pressure and his calm nature in all situations
If someone wants to learn more about cricket , I will advise them to watch the batting of greats such as Sachin , Dravid , Lara , and Ponting
To learn more about bowling , one should watch Akram , Warne , and Murali
I will also recommend reading more about cricket on cricinfo
It has nice articles , reviews and statistics on many players and games
Reading biographies of some famous cricketers will also help to understand the insights of the game in depth
Cricket is going through a rough phase due to match-fixing and betting scandals
But I am sure it will emerge stronger from this and will spread its wings all across the world , and once again put on a magnificent show for its lovers
I met a friend about one week ago , and he asked me a question that I ca n't stop thinking about : What is on my bucket list ?
I ca n't stop thinking about it , because I realized that I had never stopped to think about my life in such a deep way
By the way , do you know what a Bucket List is ?
It is a list of things you want to do before you die
I think it 's kind of sad that I do n't know what I want to do ; I do n't know what makes me truly happy
About two weeks before I met him , I watched a very beautiful movie called `` The Fault in Our Stars ''
It 's about a teen couple who are dying because of cancer , and they have different perspectives on life and death
This movie has touched me very deeply ; it made me think about life and the way people used to live without appreciating what 's truly important
After watching this movie and considering my friend 's question , I could n't help but think about my life
Now I have the feeling that I need to live more , but I have no idea what 'more ' means
Before that , I had always thought about getting married and having kids as a way to find happiness , but now I think I need to do other things first
It is very interesting to think that it was necessary to meet someone new , from a completely different culture , to make me think about what I want in life
It is very strange that another person became curious about a profound aspect of myself , one that I had never considered
Well , next November I will travel to Europe , the one certain thing on my bucket list
However , now I have an awful feeling about what I am doing today , because for the first time in my life I am sure that I need to change something , and I think this something is almost everything
People 's lives will change in the future , and I bet it 's not for the better
Unlike popular and even some scientific understandings of history , history is not an unstoppable march towards `` progress , '' whatever that word means
It is a cyclical process
Rome had its heyday in the first century AD , but just three centuries later it had become only a shadow of its former self
The Romans of the later period were not even able to make the high-quality cement that their ancestors were able to make and had technical mastery over just a few centuries earlier
Who can safely say that three centuries from now , humans will possess all the technological knowledge that they currently take for granted ?
No one can assure such a thing
I do n't think , unless there 's another World War , that people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years
I think that over the next 50 years , the age of technology will reach its peak , and after that , there will be a decline , until a new Dark Age
But let 's pick the World War hypothesis for a second
A worldwide war is the only case in which we would see a dramatic change in people 's lives within the next 50 years
Are there prospects for a new World War at this time ?
I do n't think so , but on the other hand , what the hell do I know ?
The causes that will lead to a new World War may well be in existence right now , for all I know , and perhaps only a few very wise and intelligent people are aware of them
One day in the future , another Franz Ferdinand could be killed , and that symbolic event could serve again as an excuse for one country to declare war on another , but the true underlying causes that actually led the countries to wage war against each other would have their roots in much older times
As the causes of the Second World War had its roots in events that were the outcome of the First War , a third , hypothetical war could have its roots in a past conflict that may well have happened already
But let us not digress into that , which is another topic that falls beyond the scope of the statement on which I was assigned to write
To , Sam
From Simonetta
Date : 05/30/2014
The holidays are coming
Hi Sam !
It has been a long time since we were in touch
My family and I are going to spend some days at the same place we went to last year at the Sunshine Holiday Camp
Do you remember it ?
I 've already mentioned to you how much fun I had there and why it was great !
It would be terrific if you came with me , would n't it ?
Could you ask your parents ' permission ?
In this camp , parents are calm and do n't worry about their children because they are in the care of a large number of assistants , and the camp is situated on an entire island
In addition , the site was purpose-built to provide places suitable for young people , allowing them to do lots of activities in safety
There are a wide range of activities promoted by the staff , all with the aim of enjoyment , especially outdoor sport activities !
There are two swimming pools , two tennis courts , one football pitch , and canoeing courses , among other facilities , but what I like most is scuba diving , for which the equipment is provided
The camp is well-known and opens from May to October
I am looking forward to receiving your answer
Best wishes
Simonetta
The doorbell rang unexpectedly
I got up , then I made my way to the front door
Outside stood the most extraordinary-looking man , he looked like a Spanish elephant hunter
I was taken aback , so I called my mother , who was asleep with her boyfriend
She came down , but she did not scream
Instead she started crying
It turned out that the man was my father , who had been missing for 15 years
I did not know that he was still alive
Mother had always told me she had died in the war
I think she did this for my own good
I was very bemused by the situation and did n't know if I liked him or not
In my dreams , I saw him as an intellectual , but in reality , he stood in my sitting room , looking more like an elephant than the refined figure I had imagined , with an air of exoticness about him
It was very odd to see him in my home
Now we all live together
Although the first days were difficult , now we all get along well
It is great to be together as a whole family again
The Grand Place is the central square of Brussels
It is surrounded by several old buildings , such as the city hall and medieval guildhalls , which date back to the Middle Ages
These were groups of people doing the same work , such as carpenters
They helped each other and the older ones taught the youngsters
Sometimes they became very rich
Each building is decorated with the blazon of the corporation
Their architecture is unique and beautiful
Today , most of them are hosting cafés , shops and restaurants that attract a lot of tourists , and there is also the city museum
The square is covered with pavement , and it is a pedestrianized area
It is an important place in history because it is the oldest Grand Place in Europe , and it is a part of the oldest neighbourhood of Brussels , which is made of narrow paved streets , old and high buildings , and , among other things , chocolate shops
Recently , several of the buildings have been restored and we can now better see their beautiful gilding and carvings
Every year , when Christmas comes , there is an amazing show with music and lights on the façades of the buildings while a huge fir tree is placed in the center of the square
Wawel Royal Castle is one of the highest ranked monuments in Polish and European history and culture , making it a necessary visit during your stay in Poland
The first castle , called palatium , was built in the 11th century , and the remains of it are still visible inside the walls
Over the next centuries , it was expanded , and in the 16th century , it was finally rebuilt in the Renaissance style , which has remained unchanged to this day - the most representative remnant is probably the famous arcaded courtyard
During the tour , the visitors are shown several rooms and apartments , as well as Royal Private Apartments with far-famed tapestries of Polish kings ' collection
Another attraction of the tour is visiting the Crown Treasury , where Polish coronation insignia were stored , and the armoury
In addition to the main exhibits , there are also many marvellous exhibitions in the Castle , including its history and other collections
While visiting Wawel Royal Castle , one can not omit seeing Dragon 's Den - a cave under the castle , where , according to the oldest legends , the dragon of Wawel lived
I recommend visiting Wawel Royal Castle because of its beauty and uniqueness
It is a symbol of a thousand years of Polish history and culture
Everyone will find something interesting among the variety of exhibitions and tours , and certainly it will be a memorable experience
I have been learning English as a second language since I was ten years old , which is a very long time
I think I am very lucky because I have had the opportunity to learn English naturally , without relying on books and tough lessons
My teachers thought it was better to learn by speaking , singing , and doing other activities , such as these , in English , in a way similar to how we learn our native language
Moreover , I travelled to England and lived with English families for a few weeks every summer , from when I started learning English until I was fifteen years old
So I grew up thinking I could speak and write quite well in English
Even though I have some theoretical knowledge about English grammar rules , I can make myself understood in everyday conversations , and I can write an email to a friend without making too many mistakes
One year ago I decided to take the Cambridge Advanced English exam to test my knowledge , thinking that it would not be very difficult for me to be successful
I decided to enroll for a creative writing course in order to practice my writing skills
Throughout the course , I had to accomplish some writing assignments and submit them for peer evaluation
And there , I realised at least two things : firstly , that it is possible to learn how to write better ; secondly , that even when you can make yourself generally understood , it is not so easy to be precise
A magician uses a dove and a black hat , but it would not be a magic show if he did not know how to perform the trick
I had the ideas and the words , but I knew I needed to learn the rules of grammar to write with precision and style
Adolescence exists
Everybody says it is the best period in our whole life
Adolescence could be compared to a foggy path , and even when it seems you can see something through it , in reality , you do n't
This awful fog is composed of our uncontrolled emotions
Everything is unknown , but we try to pretend that we know many things
This could be one of the reasons why we get angry so easily and so often with our parents : every time we discover something new , they judge us , and whenever we say something , they either judge us or launch into long speeches to try to change our ideas
Another aspect of the relationship between parents and adolescents is the fact that parents can be confusing to adolescents
As I said , adolescents can be very confused , and if there 's something that gets under our skin , it 's when moms say something and then tell us to do the opposite
The worst part is that they get angry with us
We are confused ; they are not clear , and then they also get angry , and they are surprised when we get mad at them
It 's true that we should always be respectful , but sometimes it turns out to be impossible because they do everything to provoke us
I think the most important thing in a relationship with our parents is to find a sense of accord , because , in the end , we do n't only feel anger towards them , but also a lot of love
Love is a new feeling that adolescents have to face
It 's not the usual love they 're used to feeling , like the love for family and friends , but it 's a new kind of love
It 's a kind of love that struggles , it gives us butterflies in our stomach and makes us dive into a sort of imaginary tale
That kind of love that we see in movies , and we dream of , the type of love that does n't make us fall asleep at night
It is a period in which we have our first experiences , and it is equally scary and exciting
Adolescence is like this : there 's a moment that looks magical , and in the next one , you drown in darkness
Dear Group Leader ,
First of all , I would like to thank you for the interest shown in our small village
I really hope that you feel welcome and please make yourself at home
Here , in Mallorca , there are a lot of places to visit , but I recommend to you a unique place , with no tourists , noise , or crowded beaches
On the east coast of Mallorca , you will find a small and beautiful village called Artà
In the municipality of Artà , you will find a coastal town , situated at the foot of the Llevant mountain range
Sa Colònia de Sant Pere is a traditional fishing village
Nowadays , you can still see some fishermen fishing on the seashore
Your adventure starts here
In order to get to your destination , you must ride a bicycle , and enjoy the splendid panoramic view
You will ride until Cala Canos , one of the most beautiful beaches of the island of Mallorca
This zone is part of a protected area , which is a natural park
For that reason , you must go riding a bike or go for a walk
As Machado said , `` se hace camino al andar
It means that what is most important is the journey
Riding a bike near the seashore with the sea breeze is one of the most relaxing experiences one can have
On the way to Cala cans , you will see the typical Mediterranean vegetation
There are a lot of trees called `` tamarix '' , native trees of the coast of Mallorca
Moreover , you will go between two ancient obelisks which have been recently restored
Finally , you will get to Cancun
It is a special beach with stones instead of sand , and surrounded by trees instead of hotels
There you can practice different sports
It is a perfect place to go diving because you can see different types of fish , sea urchins , and seaweed
There you can also take a canoe and paddle in the quiet sea
Apart from sports , you should note two different culture points
On the one hand , there is what remains standing of edifices that were used to keep the small boats of the local fishermen safe from storms
On the other hand , there is a prehistoric tower called Talaiot
The function of the Talaiots is not clear yet
Maybe it was a defensive tower or an important building for high-class people
It is important to stay on the beach until the sun goes down
The sunset in that place is ideal and romantic , ( especially if you are with your partner ) , and you will see how the sun sets behind the mountain range of Tramuntana
From that seashore , you can see all of Alcúdia Bay , part of the Serra de Tramuntana mountain range , and the Cape of Formentor
Cala Cans is a mixture of the sea , nature and culture
I am sure that you will like it and , of course , I need to ask you a favour : Please , keep the secret
Regards
Paula exists
Introduction
The aim of this report is to outline the strengths and weaknesses of your centre after one year of operation
This report analyzes the two main facilities , the gym and the swimming pool
The gym exists
The machines are fantastic , and the staff are very helpful with every customer
On the other hand , the gym is too small
Every afternoon it is crowded , so it is very difficult to exercise
The swimming pool is open
It is ideal for people who do not compete because it is only about 20 metres long
Furthermore , it is not too deep , so it is excellent for people who want to learn how to swim
On the other hand , the changing rooms are too far from the main area , so it is easy to catch a cold when walking between them
Conclusions
The facilities are quite modern , and the staff are excellent , but the gym could be bigger
Furthermore , you would put heaters in the passageway from the changing rooms to the swimming pool to prevent people from catching colds
The Future of Public Transport
When we imagine the future , we rarely imagine overcrowded buses and rusty subway trains
As technologies develop and become cheaper , more and more people buy personal cars
A car allows us to move faster and be more independent
Travelling by car is also much more convenient
Does this all mean that the era of public transportation comes to an end ?
In my opinion , it is not true
Firstly , there will always be people who will not be able to afford to buy a car
Students , children from large families , and old people will continue to use public transportation for a long time
Secondly , cars can also serve as public transport
Science fiction often depicts the future as a world where cars are used freely
Anyone can use the nearest car they see
Thirdly , people do not have an inborn driving skill , so even in the future , children and teenagers will need the public transportation
This is also true for older people , who lose the ability to drive as they age
In conclusion , public transportation is not likely to disappear , at least for the next few tens of years
The chart above gives some information about the average monthly salaries of nurses and doctors in four different countries
According to the chart , the two countries with the lowest salaries are Country A and Country B
These countries are called `` source countries '' , which means that they provide a supply of healthcare workers to other countries
Otherwise , the countries with the highest salaries are country C and country D
Moreover , in the first three countries , doctors earn about twice as much as nurses , excluding the last country , Country D
In Country D , the salaries of doctors are about three times higher than those of nurses
In conclusion , we can say that from the standpoint of the doctors and nurses , working abroad is a much better deal
Boxing is a common , well-known and well-loved sport amongst most countries in the world ; however , it is also punishing , dangerous and disliked to the extent that many people want it banned , possibly with good reason
Boxing is a dangerous sport ; there are relatively common deaths , tragic injuries , and even diseases that result from it
All professional boxers are at risk of being killed in their next fight
If it is not killed , then it is more likely to be paralyzed
Over the last ten years , several top boxers have suffered tragic losses during their careers
This is just from the elite few , and there 's more from those below them
`` Fewer deaths would occur through boxing if it were banned
The sport would go underground , and as a result , there would be no safety measures , such as gloves , doctors , paramedics , or the early stopping of the fight if someone appeared unable to continue
With this going on , the situation will be dangerous for people taking part , and it will be on the streets
Dangerous dogs that were trained to kill and maim in similar underground dog fights have already proved deadly to innocent people ; the new boxers could be even more at risk
Once boxing is banned and no one grows up knowing it as acceptable , there will be no interest in boxing , and hopefully , less overall interest in violence
Changing the rules of boxing slightly would greatly improve the safety of the sport and not detract from the entertainment
There are all sorts of proposals
Even if a boxer is successful and manages not to be seriously hurt , he still faces serious consequences in later life
Many other sports , such as motor sports and even mountaineering , are more dangerous than boxing and have real risks
Boxers chose to box , just as racing drivers drive
In many lesser-known works of modern literature , there is an emphasis on rebellion against oppressive forces
Although such a show of strength by the characters of these works is sometimes viewed as violent and thus a negative contribution to the otherwise insightful thought of the author , many stories in ethnic American literature are based on this kind of conflict
However , such a rebellion can not be seen clearly in each minority work , and , therefore , the products of ethnic American literature can not be categorized as merely the result of years of oppression
Rather , this ever-changing and ever-challenging aspect of minority literature creates an especially important necessity for each work to be considered individually , both as a product of years of struggle and as a work inherently distinct from any other
In minority works , the conflict and rebellion are presented to reflect society as a whole accurately
Rebellion is seen not as a distinct force in minority cultures , but rather as a binding force between all cultures
Rebellion and conflict are emphasized in ethnic American literature , but they are not portrayed more strongly in minority works than in other literature
Emphasis changes across different works ; although figures of authority are particularly oppressive in works such as Like Water for Chocolate and The Color Purple , other minority works , including Love Medicine and Jazz , do not reflect the clearly defined authoritarian figures or the obvious rebellion shown through the characters ' responsive actions in the previously mentioned works
This again implies that these ethnic American pieces of literature can not be categorized as merely rebellious responses to oppression , but as individual reflections of personal and cultural experiences
How does Voltaire tackle the question of philosophical optimism in 'Candide ' ?
Philosophical optimism — l'optimisme — is the philosophy that everything and every occurrence is ultimately for good
Voltaire sets out in Candide to criticize this philosophy
In Candide , the representative of this philosophy is Pangloss , the philosopher employed at Thunder-ten-Tronck
The whole book is a criticism of optimism
For example , when Candide is forced to join the Bulgarian army , he is beaten almost to death , but Candide does not concern himself because he knows it is for his own good
Although this situation may seem positive at first , it is actually not due to his training
Voltaire shows his dislike of optimism when Pangloss , Candide , and James are caught in a bad storm at sea
The storm was caused by an earthquake , which destroyed the city to which Candide was sailing
On arrival , they see starvation and death
Candide was obviously horrified , especially when the sailor began pillaging the city
Candide looks to Pangloss for an answer , but Pangloss can only tell him that some good will come out of it
Candide , although remaining true to the ideals of optimism , always appears to be sceptical of it
This is especially true when he arrives in the new world , South America , and has to leave his darling Cunégonde with the Commissioner of the province
Candide can not see what good could possibly come of this , especially as he was in America because he had killed a Jewish man and an Archbishop who were Cunégonde 's lovers
Throughout the book , we begin to see how Candide is gradually led away from l'optimisme , or perhaps more importantly , how l'optimisme is shown to be the philosophy of despair
The constant belief that good can come from bad is not actually inspiring , but it leads to a constant flow of disasters
Candide 's life in the book appears to show this
He is thrown out of Thunder-den-Tronck , he is duped into the army , he is caught in an earthquake , he is almost killed as part of an auto-da-fé , he kills three churchmen , he is almost eaten , he finds Eldorado but leaves - the list continues
Candide 's life is governed by his belief that the good will prevail
Eventually , of course , he does marry Cunégonde but she is not the beautiful young flower that he once loved
She has become ugly and has grown worse by the day
This illustrates emphatically the folly of optimism
Candide has travelled the world in search of Cunégonde , with the hope that he will marry her
Voltaire , in Candide , shows how the philosophy of optimism is one of despair , not hope
It would be tempting to think of the various European Communities as an embryonic United States of Europe , especially when we hear politicians talk of the importance of European unity
However , it is important to realize that Europe is far from becoming similar to the United States
When the original 13 American states resolved to form what is now the United States of America , they were intent on forming a political , as well as economic , entity
They were prepared to yield as much of their own sovereignty as was necessary for the newly formed national government to operate effectively as a unified political entity on the international stage
A balance was therefore struck in the constitution to allow the individual states as much self-government as possible while ensuring that , for example in military matters , the central government spoke for all
It is true that today one still hears the old dispute over state sovereignty and attempts to return some power to the individual states , but no one would challenge the fact that , on matters external to the United States , the government in Washington represents the sole policy-making body
In Europe , it is quite clear that many people would like to see a political union of the countries , since this would produce a formidable international military force
However , it is equally clear that while the European Communities may take unified political action , as seen in Europe 's response to the British involvement in the Falkland Islands dispute , they were initially intended to be purely economic entities
Membership almost certainly involves some loss of national sovereignty , but the United Kingdom could probably leave the community by a simple majority vote in the Westminster Parliament , something that no state in the United States could lawfully do
We are still a very long way from a single parliament for Western Europe with power to make political decisions for all ; and even with 1992 approaching , and a single market , the gulf between the UK and Europe is very wide
The supremacy of Parliament will never be challenged
Its ability to make and break any law - made by it or Europe - means that it retains full sovereignty
Even if today it made laws that would unite it fully with Europe and relinquish its sovereignty forever , it could tomorrow repeal all those laws
The fact that Parliament does not bind itself or can not be bound by any political body means that it can never lose its sovereignty unless a majority of the population desires it and Parliament consents
But with the average jingoistic Briton , there is little chance of curing ourselves of xenophobia and becoming fully integrated with Europe
Even now that the Channel Tunnel has joined us to the continent , we still consider ourselves separated from the world , standing alone against a hostile world
Naturally , the problems of a single Europe would run as deeply as the benefits we would ultimately receive
It seems to me that for the past few centuries Britain has always considered itself to be detached from the rest of Europe
Whenever necessary , she has allied herself to European powers , such as in times of war or extreme distrust
Britain has been eager to maintain a secure balance of power on the continent , but throughout history , she has been more concerned with her overseas empires than with anywhere else
In the latter half of the century , however , her empire has diminished and she has had to face increasing responsibilities in Europe
Because of her history of isolated sovereignty , it is difficult to accept being a part of Europe
For instance , British law is based largely upon precedent , that is , judge-made law
We have established a system of law that dates back many centuries and is widely known and respected
There is very little European influence on our law ; however , in many respects , our law will be similar , but the lack of European influence will also result in many differences
With the creation of a single , unified Europe , new laws will have to be adopted throughout the continent , and this will likely cause both confusion and conflict
The British tend to be very proud and possessive of the law , and changes to it may well cause bad feeling and discontent
Of course , the same points will apply to the monetary system in Europe
Will there just be one system ?
The country is typically against major changes , and something as fundamental as money would cause problems if it were to be altered
Our monetary system , I suppose , could be seen as a symbol of sovereignty
It can be said that if a single Europe were created , problems may arise over its fundamental political concepts
Of course , Britain would lose its sovereignty , as would the other nations of the union
It has been suggested that a single union could be based on a basic federal structure , whereby local autonomy could be preserved , and the union as a whole could work together in a democratic manner
To a certain extent , even if sovereignty was lost , some national personality would be preserved
The fact is that even when united , European unity would still be essentially divided
There will always be aspects of one society that the others will never accept
Europe as a whole faces the same problems ; therefore , if a single , unified Europe were created , including Britain , the problems could be dealt with quickly and efficiently
If the Federalists achieved their aims of European unity , they would strive to achieve and promote democracy at the national level , thus preserving individuality , and showcase all their positive attributes
The problem facing the British really results from their isolated past
The sovereignty of the nation has deep roots , and the fears of losing it are great
Whether this would happen remains to be seen , and it would depend completely on the terms of the union , as well as the negotiations , and the feelings of both the general public and the politicians of these countries
With 1992 only a year away , the question of what a Single Europe will mean for Britain becomes increasingly relevant
I firmly believe that the advent of 1992 will result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain
This loss , however , does not need to be negative
In fact , in political , economic , and defense terms , I feel this relocation of resources can and will be very positive
While I may be guilty of having an island mentality to some extent , I would n't go so far as to say that Britain is in danger of handing all control over to faceless bureaucrats in Brussels , or in Strasbourg
Throughout the world , a wind of change is apparent , but especially in Europe
This process will continue , and the rest of the world , including Europe , will evolve with or without Britain 's participation in this process
`` I believe Britain must play a role in shaping the global policies that will define the future international political and economic landscape
However , to be fully involved , sacrifices have to be made
Such sacrifices will involve certain aspects of our sovereignty
In relinquishing and thus centralizing certain powers , the aim is not to diminish the strength of individual nations but to increase the overall impact of Europe on the world stage
As amply demonstrated by recent events in the Gulf , European cooperation in the field of defense can be both impressive and effective
I can see a future for some form of European rapid reaction force
Although to some extent defense costs could be cut , this would not necessarily lead to a reduction in the availability of defense
In political terms , regardless of legislation , Britain , like the rest of Europe , is becoming increasingly cosmopolitan in terms of the population composition
The North Sea will increasingly come to represent a mere puddle as people become accustomed to moving between countries , thereby diminishing its perceived size and significance
I feel it is important for Britain to fully integrate with its European partners to adapt to these demographic changes
Politically , nations are moving closer together
Possible problems should be studied and solved before they happen , if possible
E
Whilst not pretending to fully understand this system , I do know that no system can lower interest rates and raise growth at the same time , with the possible exception of the Magic Circle
In the area of the single currency , again , I feel this is inevitable
What is important is to base this currency on strong currencies within the EEC , as opposed to an average-based system
To conclude , I would say that a single Europe is already happening and will continue to do so , which is certain
Britain must not concern itself with the loss of sovereignty but rather the gain of its European equivalent
If we miss the boat , I think we will drown before the next boat comes
When the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957 , the foundation was laid for a new continent—a united Europe
It was said that Europe would not be created quickly but over several years
When Britain entered the European Community in 1973 , after a national referendum , the debate began concerning Britain 's relationship with Europe
When 1992 was set as the date for the Single European Market , the debate flared up again , but over how far Britain should be integrated
The rest of Europe seems prepared for 1992 , but Britain seems to be decidedly hesitant
The former Prime Minister , Margaret Thatcher , was not willing to lead Britain into a united Europe because she felt it would lead to a loss of British sovereignty
There is no doubt that an integrated market would have multiple benefits for the countries involved
Businesses and other trading organizations are preparing themselves for 1992 and the single market
Trade will be easier with no border controls , allowing for the free-flowing transportation of merchandise
There will be business booms and free competition with the removal of protective practices , along with greater freedom to travel
Many Britons consider that Europe has already had too much of an impact on Britain , as evidenced by decimalization , the introduction of new Euro passports , and the pound sterling being tied to the ECU
They may feel that Britain is being pulled into Europe
Further changes are forecast for Britain , affecting day-to-day matters , to create a `` European Standard ''
This may make Britons resentful of Europe and tired of `` 1992 and all that ''
A single market requires one central institution to coordinate all movements of goods and policies
Will the people of Britain be prepared to give up their government and be directed from Strasbourg or Brussels ?
Many people would not attend
Will the day come when the pound sterling is taken over by the euro ?
It may well happen , but will the Britons have a chance to voice their opinions and views ?
Europe may argue that the benefits from a single integrated market would far outweigh any national drawbacks
As the date draws nearer , the awareness of Britons about Europe must increase
They must look into the future and consider possible effects
Will Britain be drawn into Europe against its will ?
Perhaps as more of Britain becomes Europeanized , Britons will wake up and realize that their sovereignty is being taken away
Britain is geographically a part of Europe
We are in the EEC , and we should be able to benefit from free trade
We have been an island for too long , having been independent and able to stand alone
We have a sound democratic process , which many people would not want to give up
A fully integrated market with Britain as a full member would be to the detriment of our political system and would consequently lead to a loss of sovereignty
There has been a great deal of talk about a Single Europe in recent years , and it is hard to believe that it will soon be upon us
Now that it is a reality , and not just a probability , the question on many Britons ' minds is this : will this mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain , or the birth of a new nation ?
Firstly , we will take a positive approach
Looking at things from an economic perspective , this is not a problem
The benefits in terms of cost-cutting , due to doing things only once , instead of twelve times , will be enormous
Firms , by pooling their resources , will be able to devote more time to research and development , thus improving their products
Europe will therefore be a continent to be reckoned with in competition
At a more individual level , the standard of living for every member of the new Single Europe should increase
A greater number of ideas from a wider range of experts will , in theory , result in more knowledgeable and better-informed individuals
Simplicity is one of the Commission 's key aims , with the idea that if things are simpler and easier for everyone to understand , people will be happier and get on better
If this is so , they should also work better
Ideally , then , there should be more equality , less crime , greater productivity , and greater economic growth
On the other hand , will a Single Europe mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain ?
It must be remembered that not only does Britain have a small population compared to the majority of the other member states , but it is also an island , which none of the others are
Why should this matter ?
Well , Britain has quite a history and therefore a fair number of traditions
It is possible that it could become engulfed in the new Single Europe , and lose its identity
Britons ( especially those from older generations ) may then feel lost and that they do not really belong anymore
The new Single Europe may be too new and unknown for them to pledge their allegiance to it
Will all this idealism really work ?
Will there be greater prosperity , better-informed , and happier citizens , or will politicians ' inability to agree on policies prevent this from ever happening ?
Britain , although small , is more often than not at the forefront of international matters , taking a definite stance on what it considers to be right
Does it not have a great deal at stake , at the very least its character , in integrating itself into a unified Europe ?
No one would dispute that this is a difficult question
The fact remains , nevertheless , that next year , in 1992 , there will be a unified European market
This , as everyone is well aware , is not going to be achieved with ease , but the more tolerant every member state is of each other , the more successful a Single European entity will be
It is up to Britain , therefore , to accept this fact and to show an example by leading the way in terms of tolerance
Then we will all be able to look at the future in a more positive way
The European Community is a unique grouping of twelve sovereign European Member States that are committed to the development of closer economic and political cooperation
The community aims to break down the economic and political barriers that have traditionally divided Europe
In particular , the community seeks to facilitate greater movement within its frontiers ; movement not only of goods but of services , capital , and people
However , the issue of sovereignty is certainly a much-debated one : to what extent , if any , should a member hand over its sovereignty to the Community ?
Let us look at the founding of the European Community , before we discuss the issue of sovereignty in more detail
There were several attempts at peaceful unification after the First World War , but , after Europe had again been devastated by war , the futility of national rivalry was truly apparent
The political and economic exhaustion of the European states called for a fresh start and a far more radical approach to the reordering of Europe
This fresh start came about because of three main factors
Firstly , was Europe 's realization of its own weakness , after having lost its age-old position at the centre of the world stage to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union
These superpowers were economically , militarily and politically stronger than the divided individual European states
Secondly , the conviction was that military conflict should in the future be avoided ; after all , the two great wars had both begun as European `` civil wars ''
One of the first major moves towards European integration was the creation of the European Economic Community in 1958
Its membership has grown from the ten original founder countries to twenty-three
One of the most innovative features of the European Community , compared with other international bodies , is that its member states have ceded part of their national sovereignty to it , endowing it with sovereign powers
This novel approach to pooling national sovereignty is called `` integration ''
The 1970s saw progress in integration , with the introduction of community policy instruments , which enabled a greater scope for national policies
All of the member states agree in principle to the idea of a single market by 1992 ; however , each wishes its own interests to be safeguarded
This is to say that no one wants to sacrifice their national sovereignty ; many want voting to be unanimous , instead of majority voting
Many see this issue as a threat to their own regulations and laws , and they could foresee a drop in standards if they do not stand firm
The situation is seen as a threat to the countries in question that do not wish to give up their sovereignty for the sake of European unity
Whether or not the continuation of the progress in the field of European unity is successful depends very much on the people of Europe
If a feeling of European unity develops and can be sustained , the threat will subside as a feeling of identity takes over
On Britain 's roads , there is an ever-increasing volume of traffic
The road network is no longer able to carry this traffic without hold-ups and traffic jams
To remedy this , the government has started adding a fourth lane on some stretches of our motorways and constructing ring roads and bypasses , with mixed reception
While the road system is being improved , there seems to be an endless series of roadworks which restrict the highways , and cause further delay
The inability to cope with the amount of traffic by the road system obviously increases the risk of drivers having an accident , and drivers must be constantly alert since they are often in heavy traffic
It might seem like an easy solution to this mayhem would be to use public transport , i
People are not using the rail system because of its lack of integration due to the recent privatization of different areas
It has been shown that different companies charge different fares for exactly the same route
The main disadvantage of the railways is that , as the rail service and the bus service are normally owned by different companies , it is unlikely that you can walk onto a bus off the train
If the services were integrated , there would be a bus timetable which coincided with the train arrival times
Then people would be more likely to catch the train , as they would not have to look forward to a long walk , wait for a bus or an expensive taxi ride
My solution to the problem would be to improve the rail system and its related bus services , this would get people off the roads and onto the trains
To improve the rail service , trains must be timed to arrive and depart at key times , such as arriving at 8:00 and leaving at 6:30
The train and bus companies have to liaise with each other , and the train fares have to remain relatively cheap , i
The basic dilemma facing the UK 's rail and road transport systems is the general rise in population
This leads to an increase in the number of commuters and transport users every year , consequently putting pressure on the UK 's transport network
The biggest worry for the system is the rapid rise of car users outside the major cities
Most large cities have managed to encourage commuters to use public transport , thus decreasing major congestion in rush hour periods
Public transport is the obvious solution to the increase in population if it is made cheap to commuters , clean , easy , and efficient , then it could take the strain off the overloaded British roads
For commuters who regularly travel long distances , rail transport should be made more appealing , more comfortable , and cheaper
Motorways and other transport links are constantly being extended , widened , and modified , which is slowly turning the country into a concrete jungle
The mass of vehicle transport creates another major problem : the pollution emitted into the atmosphere , which damages the ozone layer , creates smog , and forms acid rain
In conclusion , I wish to propose clean , efficient , comfortable , and cheap public transport for the near future
The modern traffic jam is now a familiar situation to nearly all , of the Western world 's population
If every time we use our cars to travel any distance , we find ourselves in a 10-mile traffic backup , why do we still insist that we travel in such a meandering route
To illustrate my point , if every time you took a train it stopped for 2 hours on the track , everyone would stop taking it
So , why do we still insist on traveling by road ?
The answer most likely lies in two areas , firstly , the attitude of many westerners is that `` it is their right to travel in such a manner ''
In my opinion , this shows considerable ignorance
I am not an environmentalist who wants to make everyone live in tepees and eat soybean soup ; however , I do agree that something should be done about the volume of traffic on our roads today
The government 's answer to the considerably growing amount of traffic on our roads is just to move backwards ; they are not even attempting to treat the cause , and then more and more people are driving
We all feel that we have a right to be on the road
Why ?
Do we , the Western world , which accounts for only 5 % of the world 's population , have the right to use the resources of the rest of the world at an environmental cost ?
We do n't get out of bed a bit earlier to catch the public transport just because we can not be bothered
Even if we did , then so does the rest of the world shortly
That could have disastrous implications
The second reason is the problem that the public transport service , for example rail , has declined so much ; there is no train to catch in the morning
People stopped using trains because of the fall in standards
The whole system has now formed a vicious cycle of traffic
This has now been intensified with the sale of the railways to private rail companies , which are profit-motivated
The vital small rail links may now be closed
The only way to stop the circle will be to break it
Today , boxing has become a very popular sport , with TV channels competing for coverage of certain events and fighters earning a lot of money ; this has become a big business
Apart from athletics , boxing seems to be the only popular international sport of which Britain can still hold its head high
We have superb fighters with excellent character , such as Lennox Lewis , Nigel Benn , Naseem Hamed , and our beloved Frank Bruno
Despite being enjoyable to watch , however , boxing is very dangerous
Blows to the head can cause the brain to rattle about the skull , which may lead to a brain clot or a tumor
Last year , the fight between Chris Eubank and Michael Watson led to calls for boxing to be banned when Michael Watson slipped into a coma and was in a critical condition for several months
Many youths in low-income areas see boxing as ' a way out ' , a chance to make it to the top and earn a lot of money on their way
There are , however , people who regard boxing as barbaric , brutal and primitive
These people argue that there is no need for boxing , and that it only promotes violence
During the fight , yes , of course it is violent , but this is controlled violence ; fighters have a mutual respect for each other
All precautions are taken to ensure a safe flight
During fights , doctors were kept close to the ring and had the authority to call it off prematurely if required
Ambulances are also kept on standby at big events
Although it may sound cruel , I do not believe that any fighter has entered a professional boxing career without knowing the risks
Because there are so many budding young boxers , to ban boxing would be insane ; it would almost certainly go underground
Underground fights are far more dangerous since less protective gear is used , and there usually is n't a doctor present
Taking this into account and considering that boxing is a sport that involves hitting and potentially hurting one 's opponent , it can nonetheless be argued that , relative to other full-contact sports , boxing is a relatively safe sport
Although far less popular , there are other sports that are far more brutal and dangerous , such as 'Thai Boxing ' , where competitors are encouraged to use their knees and elbows
The argument continues , but in the long term , I believe boxing will not be banned for the sake of safety
This is good news for the majority of the British public
Two men , one ring : only one can leave
Although rules have been made throughout the years to dilute the sport 's sadistic side , should boxing be banned ?
Every time a boxer gets punched in the head , their brain moves vigorously inside their skull
This causes the boxer to lose many brain cells in each fight , and if this happens frequently , the boxer risks ending his career with brain damage
In my opinion , and probably that of others , this is reason enough for the banning of boxing
To say the least , the sport is actually a blood sport
But there is one exception - the original example , which is also the first reference for why boxing should be banned : the tragic accident where Michael Watson was put into a coma by Chris Eubank , the man who does n't specifically go into fights to knock out his opponents
This example proves all too well what a dangerous so-called 'sport ' boxing is
The boxing federation is trying to do as much as it can to make the sport safer , with ringside doctors , and by banning bare-hand fights
There is always much speculation over the dangers of such a brutal sport as boxing
This is emphasized and exaggerated when a competitor in the sport tragically dies
A recent death in the ring has inevitably led to a public uproar on the safety of the sport , and the controversy over whether the sport should be banned or not is once again at the forefront of discussion
Let us consider how a professional boxer would feel
He is clearly aware of the dangers and brutality of the sport , which may explain why he enjoys it so much
I have yet to hear any boxer express regret over their choice of career
The excitement of being in the ring , the joy at knocking an opponent onto the canvas , and all the money that is there to be made are overwhelming factors that keep boxers fighting
The money that is there for the taking for the very best is ridiculous , and with some top boxers earning sums of money , such as £20 million ( or in Mike Tyson 's comeback case , $ 60 million ! ) , it 's no surprise how important the sport is to some
Let 's consider Sky views , which recently began a subscription to view Tyson 's `` Next Live Lights ''
This member of the public does not want the sport to be banned either
Now , let us consider the friends or family of a boxer , who has been permanently injured ( or has been killed due to a fight )
These individuals , and others who have learned about the tragic incident in the media , are protesting against the sport
The family , who were originally against the idea of their son finishing college early to take up the sport , would be leading the protests against boxing
The British public felt pleased , proud , and patriotic when Frank Bruno achieved his ultimate goal and became the Heavyweight Champion of the world
This hypocritical view is held by so many that whether boxing should be banned or not will remain a controversial issue for the foreseeable future
There were two main objections raised against the introduction of the national lottery
The first objection was that the lottery would be little more than another form of taxation , in fact , no more than a tax on the poor
The second and main objection came from charities , which predicted that charitable donations would decrease with the introduction of the lottery
There was also some controversy over the awarding of the lottery operating franchise , which eventually went to Camelot
Richard Branson promised to give all of his profits to charity , but his offer was rejected
My personal objections to Camelot as the lottery organiser are that a large proportion of the firms in the consortium are American or foreign , for example , IBM has a sizeable stake in Camelot
The British national lottery is run by non-British firms
Since its introduction , there has been more controversy over the national lottery
When it promised to give 45 pence in every pound to charitable causes , it failed to guarantee that most , or indeed all , of this money would actually go to charity
There has also been some controversy over the allocation of money
For example , 3 million pounds were given to Eton College , one of the richest public schools , and money was also donated to the Royal Opera House
The lottery seemed to be a reverse Robin Hood , stealing from the poor to give to the rich
The lottery has also suffered allegations that it is addictive , especially with the introduction of scratch cards
It has been claimed that it is so addictive that people will spend all their available cash on lottery tickets , only to be disappointed
It has been calculated that only 4 pence out of every pound received by the lottery goes to charitable causes , while the rest is used for tax , the prize fund , profits , and what are termed charities
It has also been calculated that the chance of winning anything substantial is one in a million , i
It has also been alleged that the jackpots are too high ; most of the lucky winners have said themselves that the jackpot has ruined their life , alienating them from friends and family
In conclusion , I think that the lottery should be retained , but not in its present form
I would also remove any American business interests and give the charity money to more deserving charity
Now that the lottery is in place , it would be very difficult to remove it from society
The computer has been one of the most influential inventions of all time
Computers now dominate most of government business , science , and communication , as well as many other areas of human life
In many ways , it has taken the place of the human brain in performing calculations and thought processes
The most obvious example of this is the calculator , an instrument used by mathematicians and scientists to perform numerical calculations
This has made it no longer necessary for humans to perform calculations and solve equations , and therefore they no longer need to understand the principles behind them
This unfortunately means that the genius scientist is being replaced by the powerful computer and its operator , who needs only to know which buttons to press
This may seem like an extreme view , as there is still much in the world of maths and science which a computer can not calculate , but this may not be the case centuries into the future
Computers have been used as a means of keeping records
Computer-generated pictures , including 'fractal ' pictures drawn from equations , seem to be more popular than hand-printed images from an artist 's imagination , while computer games seem to provide more entertainment than any game or activity that takes place in the real physical world
Virtual reality allows people to have 3-D entertainment created by a computer
Whether or not the computer is taking over from the human brain , it has certainly made the human body almost obsolete
People , businesses or corporations can be contacted from anywhere around the globe by fax machines , e-mail and the internet , and some people prefer these forms of communication over face-to-face meetings
Money can be transferred instantly without even needing to move the actual money
However , the idea that the human brain is no longer useful is not entirely true
Human beings often act without logic or reason , and only other human beings can cope and deal with that
Also , computers can break down , and then a human is needed to take control , such as in the case of an airline pilot ; there are still certain tasks that only a human being can perform , and these are often among the simplest
They cried , and they cheered
Their faces expressed joy , triumph , pride and perplexity
The world watched in anticipation
`` We all felt that we were living one of those historic moments that you read about in a history book , and we were proud to be a part of it
Within a few weeks , the excitement had died down and people had turned their attention to more recent news
But for me , this was the start
It was the start of what we now refer to as President Bush 's `` winning of the Cold War ''
It was the event that gave the people of the Eastern Bloc countries the hope that their efforts were not in vain
Some had been executed
I had asked him once if he had n't been scared of what he would find once he left
He told me that nothing could compare to the way he had been forced to live his life there ; even though I had lost touch with this classmate , her father 's words were with me as I watched the events unfold in Germany
Bolstered by the Germans ' success , the people of Hungary , Czechoslovakia , Poland , and Romania rose against communist regimes as well
Whether the people are happier or not , I can not say
However , they will have at least seen the `` other side ''
Their struggles and hopes of forty years will not have been in vain -- Without the fall of the Berlin Wall , history probably would have taken a very different course -- In the end , I believe things would have still turned out as they did
However , history can not be rewritten , and as things stand , the Fall of the Berlin Wall actively contributed to the resurgence of hope and struggle in the rest of the Eastern Bloc
The development and implementation of technology have affected societies in every corner of the world
I do not speak of a certain object in particular , but of technology as a whole
This thing , technology is and will always be both the closest friend and yet the greatest nemesis of our world
Science and technology have allowed me to travel to this part of the world ; they have provided a living for my family , and they have cured my grandmother of cancer
The greatest problems lie in the use of the means humans have developed
Alone , they do not threaten us , but when they become combined with certain aspects and certain people in our societies , they have the potential to become the most dangerous things we possess
Speaking from my experience living in the United States , I have come to feel that technology has become a large detriment to our youth in particular
People say that technological development has made our world much smaller
I would concur that most Americans live in their own closets
In schools , Geography classes rarely , if ever , exist
Before I came to Spain , a group of children asked me if Spain was in Michigan
Explaining that Spain was located across the ocean did not seem to improve their understanding of the layout of our world
Science and technology have had effects on the U
Our awareness of other people , other cultures , and other languages is not a high priority for our educators
Until I was 15 , I was unable to study any foreign language at all , and even then I had only one choice of languages : German
Since I was twelve , I had an intense desire to learn Spanish , but due to certain circumstances , I had to wait until I was twenty years old to begin learning it
Mine is not the only experience like this
The effort of the United States has given us a voice , and the world is moving forward while my country lags behind , stuck in its own self-satisfaction
Many people argue nowadays that , with the advent of computer technology , our mental arithmetic is poor and we are becoming a nation of couch potatoes
It is true , in a way , that the development of portable calculating machines ( calculators ) has meant that we no longer need to be able to work out sums in our heads ; but at what cost ?
In many shops , the cashiers appear to be dumbfounded by the simplest of sums without the aid of their tills
In many areas , the skill of human judgment has been replaced by faster , more accurate computers
Many people have had their job positions taken over by computers
Filing cabinets are becoming a thing of the past , replaced by the computer databases
But even such menial tasks as filing are good for us
They encourage organisational skills and tidiness
When people discuss artificial intelligence ( AI ) , you often hear outlandish claims from individuals who believe that computers will become sentient and eventually surpass human intelligence
These are just the rants of people who have nothing to do with computers and who do not realize that behind every computer is a programmer
Even artificial intelligence needs to be programmed
Humans still figure out how to build computers , program them , and , more importantly , control them
In terms of making the human brain redundant , computers can help : they can teach , test , and improve our learning and linguistic skills
Reflexes are improved , and this has been scientifically proven , by playing computer games - the same things that parents say turn their children into 'zombies '
We can expand our imagination and convert our ideas into computer-simulated models , enabling us to design buildings and road networks
The computer revolution has not made our brains redundant ; it has opened up areas of them we never knew existed !
It is now the computer age
Almost everyone owns a computer or has access to one
Computers nowadays are a far cry from those in the past , which filled whole rooms
They are able to generate amazingly accurate graphical representations , and perform extremely difficult mathematical equations in just seconds
Computers have become a huge part of our lives in both areas of work and education
But are they such a good thing ?
When calculators came along , a drop in students ' ability to do mental arithmetic was obvious ; consequently , they are now used even for the simplest calculations
The computer could do the same thing
Computers encourage laziness in the general public ; why work out something yourself when the computer can do it for you ?
This is very time-saving and efficient , however , it is causing people to forget the basic ideas
For instance , spelling is no longer as important as it once was ; you can simply use a spellcheck to correct your English , which is absurd
For the youth of today , computers offer connections to people and information worldwide , as well as access to millions of facts and figures
This could be argued to be educational
However , this is killing the imagination of children and they spend hours sitting at a keyboard tapping away at home
They should be out enjoying themselves and gaining experiences instead of reading about them on a flat screen
It is said that you can meet people through computers and have relationships
I find this preposterous because people are losing the ability to communicate and form relationships
Computers can offer escape from the humdrum routine of daily life by means of games but they are mind-numbing and uninventive
There is , however , a more dangerous threat from computers : they can do a man 's work
This could lead to high unemployment
Those people who work with computers for long periods of time every day often face various health and productivity problems
The repetition of tapping keys all day and staring at the screen can be harmful
Computers may be the future , but what part will humans have in this future ?
With the possibility of being taught at home , there will be no need for people to go to school
I agree that computers are helpful , but people should not rely too heavily on them
They should read books and experience life more fully in order to regain their lost imagination and sense of adventure
I feel that in schools , work should be done mainly by hand , and calculators and computers should only be used minimally in mathematics in order to prevent the creation of computer addicts and to foster a healthier relationship with technology
There are many beneficial aspects of genetic manipulation
These include : the eradication and identification of harmful hereditary genetic disorders and the development of high-yield hybrid crops
There can be no doubt that genetic manipulation and genetic engineering have had highly beneficial effects on many areas of society
However , many people dislike or are prejudiced against genetic manipulation
Partly , this is a fear of the unknown ; something that alters the fundamental nature of plant and animal life is beyond comprehension for most people , and therefore provokes fear
People have also become aware of the immense power that genetic manipulation can give to certain individuals
This has been very good for popular culture , with the film 'Jurassic Park ' being an obvious reference point
There is , however , the very real possibility that the power of genetic manipulation could become the possession of uncontrolled , unregulated individuals who could use it for evil purposes
This , then , is an argument against scientists bearing moral responsibility for their work
Anything in life can be misused
Whether it is a kitchen knife used to stab someone , a car used to run someone over , or something as harmless as a pillow used to suffocate
Everything in life , if misused , can have harmful effects ; genetic engineering and genetic manipulation are no exception
Though the possible effects of genetic manipulation may be far larger than a kitchen knife or a car , this is purely a subjective view by present-day standards
Certainly , we would not hold the makers of a car or a kitchen knife responsible for their misuse , and there is no reason why scientists should bear the major responsibility if genetic manipulation is misused
The fundamental flaw in saying scientists must bear the major burden or , more broadly , moral responsibility for their work , is that if this had been applied universally for centuries , scientific research would never have taken place , and mankind would be without electricity , radios , and anything beyond a basic , mud-hut existence
Scientific research is not corrupt , but an essential and natural part of human development , driving the improvement of our condition
The other fundamental flaw is assuming that individual scientists have a responsibility
No one created genetic manipulation ; rather , it was a power waiting to be discovered
If one scientist does not make a discovery , then another one will
It is unfair to hold the scientist responsible who is at the forefront of human knowledge , when another scientist elsewhere may independently make the same discovery later
The only argument for making scientists responsible for their work is that they have the capability to significantly impact society , particularly in the case of genetic manipulation
While genetic manipulation is relatively new , it takes a scientist to carry it out , and therefore an individual scientist could be held responsible
But once genetic manipulation becomes commonplace in the future , and it is no longer the exclusive domain of scientists , the original scientists who discovered genetic manipulation can not be held responsible for others ' misuse of it
There are many problems facing the monarchy
Some of them are listed below
The divisions in their family , the fight between the prince and the Prince of Wales , and the possibility of a divorce
The other problem is that people say , or think , that they do not do anything , but they are rich and also do not pay any taxes
Another problem is that people think monarchy is being abolished in many countries , and since many countries are republics , they believe monarchy should be abolished in this country too
There are also arguments against abolishing the Monarchy
For example , many people like the royal family because they are honest , not like politicians who always lie
I think the royal family and the monarchy are a tradition in the UK and everywhere in the world , the UK is known for its royal family , so I do not think they should be abolished
In the end , I think that if many people want the Monarchy to be abolished , a general election should be called to determine whether the Monarchy should be abolished
`` In vitro fertilization '' is the fertilization of an egg in the laboratory , i
The egg is taken from the mother and placed in an environment that will optimize the chances of fertilization by the sperm from the father
Once fertilization has occurred , the fertilized egg is implanted back into the mother 's womb , and from there on , the pregnancy will be normal
Normally , more than one egg is taken from the mother so that the eggs can be stored and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccessful
This usually leads to multiple births
twins , triplets , etc
There are people who are against this , saying it is not natural , and questioning whether it is fair to a child who has started life in a test tube , as they believe life starts from the moment of conception
There are ethics involved regarding who is given the treatment and who is not ?
At what age should the treatment not be given ? Is it justifiable to spend so much money on in vitro fertilisation for one person when the same amount could be used to save hundreds of lives , for example by vaccinating people against measles ?
Those in favor of this idea can argue that it is the right of every person to have a child
Women who would not normally be able to have children can now have them through in vitro fertilization
Through no fault of her own , she may have a blocked fallopian tube , which could prevent eggs from reaching the womb
Technology has progressed quickly , and as a result , ethics and practical guidelines have been left behind
I therefore think it is necessary to have certain regulations , i
Fertility treatment should not be given to post-menopausal women
The menopause is the body 's way of telling you that you are too old and your body is no longer capable of bearing a baby
Last year , there was a case of a post-menopausal woman who was given in vitro fertilisation after lying about her age
I do n't think this is fair or morally right for the child
The answer is 2
Egg cells should not be taken from aborted fetuses
The fetuses will have been aborted for reasons such as if it was the result of a rape or if it had congenital deformities
There should be a guideline or law stating that eggs should only be taken from the mother and not from dead fetuses
Science has moved on dramatically since the 19th century
Many new things have been invented , and many medical things have changed
People in our modern times are now able to have liver , heart , and even lung transplants
People are able to have a whole new blood supply if it lacks sufficient requirements
All the above are carried out on living people , but nowadays biological operations can be carried out on the unborn
Bodies can start their days in test tubes
This is called 'in vitro fertilisation '
This is when an egg is removed from a woman and placed in a test tube , and then sperm is placed into the test tube , allowing the egg and sperm to fuse together , resulting in fertilization
The test tube is then incubated for a few weeks , and when the fetus is formed , the fetus is then implanted into the mother
The fetus is left to grow and develop naturally
This idea is extremely beneficial to married couples who have been trying for a baby but have been unsuccessful
In vitro fertilization allows the embryo to grow inside the mother , which enables the mother and baby to bond , making the baby feel a part of her
What I feel is ethically incorrect is when a woman who is postmenopausal decides she wants a baby
Nature has already taken its course to tell her she is too old to have any children , so why should she have one implanted in her
It is not fair on the child because when the child grows up and all the child 's friends are playing with their 30-40-year-old parents , the child 's mother could be drawing her pension , and I am sure she would not feel like playing with her child
The mother may die of old age before the child will have lived a full life , which would be unfair to the child
The child may also have to look after the mother in her old age
As the fetus begins its development from an egg fertilized in a test tube , and the sperm used for fertilization is selected , this means that the sex of the resulting offspring could also potentially be determined
The way the sex of an organism can be chosen is by using genetic selection
The woman has 2 X chromosomes and the man has one X and one Y chromosome
The sex of an offspring can be determined by the fact that the egg always contains an X chromosome , and the sperm 's nucleus can contain either an X or a Y chromosome
Sperm with an X chromosome is slightly heavier than sperm with a Y chromosome , so it can be separated
If the mother wants a boy , Y sperm is selected ; if she wants a girl , X sperm is selected
This may lead to an increase in one sex , and a decline in the other
As a result , this would reduce the population as there would be fewer couples
Additionally , what happens if most people born in the same year as you are men and you are a woman ? This would mean you are of the less common sex
Science is progressing all the time , but is this progression for the best ?
The main reason Britons are currently avoiding beef is the threat of BSE ( Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy )
This is a viral disease that attacks the central nervous system , which can be passed on through consuming the animal
In cows , it is commonly known as mad cow disease , and , by law , any cow showing these signs must be destroyed and not sold for meat
The problem , however , is that the signs are not shown for a long time , as this is a viral disease
It can be passed on to humans through eating parts of the animal , such as the brain , which is affected
The rest of the meat , however , is relatively safe ; for example , eating a steak offers very little chance of the disease being passed on
However , the British press has ignored this fact and exaggerated the situation , considering that only a very small number of people have died of the disease after a lifetime of eating beef
Another reason for the British people to stop eating beef is the push for vegetarianism , although this is a much smaller threat to the trade than the previous point about BSE
These factors could have a considerable impact on the agricultural industry , preventing the sale of British dairy livestock not only in Britain , but as well for export
With global communications as good as they are now , it could send a scare across the world about British Beef - indeed France and Germany already have restricted and some places banned the sale or import of British beef for fear of its safety
Although British farmers have learned to diversify , dairy farming and the sale of beef products still form the backbone of British agriculture , and this would completely change the face of farming in Britain
Whether they switch to sheep or vegetable crops , substantial changes would be needed to change the situation
People throughout the United Kingdom were doubtless shocked and perhaps upset by images in the national press and television news of cows that had contracted the disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy , or BSE
The so-called 'mad cow disease ' seemed to make the cows lose all sense of balance and direction , stumbling around drunkenly
Herds in which this disease was found were put down before the symptoms progressed further
Those cows , which had been put down , were not used for food
The disease infects the cow and is then present in the spinal fluid within the spine and the brain , and as the spinal fluid is usually spilled in the slaughter of cattle for meat , the risk of contamination of the meat was one that the industry was not willing to take
The human disease , Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease , or CJD , is believed to be a human form of BSE , although no clear link has yet been established between the two
It is unclear whether the incidence of CJD is on the rise or whether awareness of the condition is heightened
The government insists , perhaps correctly , that British beef is perfectly safe to eat
However , people are genuinely scared of the presence of the disease in the U
Many schools have removed beef from their menus , substituting pork and chicken , and as a result , sales of beef have shown a decline
The implications for the beef industry could be rather serious if everybody boycotts beef products
To compensate , beef prices have dropped in attempts to sell more meat , but the public remains sceptical
If beef continues to fall out of favor , then the beef industry 's future would be unclear
Beef products are present in many foodstuffs , such as jellies , fruit gums , and , of course , stock cubes
Would all these products have to find synthetic or substitute ingredients ?
Even if the entire beef industry were to grind to a halt , the large number of beef cattle worldwide would no longer be needed
Not all beef can be infected , though , and the situation has become a waiting game
For beef to be reprieved or condemned , we are forced to turn to scientists to establish whether or not BSE and CJD are linked , and more importantly , whether the latter can be contracted by eating meat contaminated with the former
The nation awaits the verdict on tenterhooks , and it is in the majority 's interest that there be no proven link
Watch this space
Personally , I believe that man is better at diagnosing CJD now than ever before
Some reports say that it can take up to 20 years to develop a vaccine , so we could all already be infected
Whatever you believe , I shall continue to enjoy my roast beef and Yorkshire pudding , thank you
There has been a big scare in Britain recently that some beef may contain BSE ( bovine spongiform encephalopathy ) , which may lead to the human equivalent of CJD ( Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease )
BSE is a disease in cows that affects their brain and spinal tissue ( or offal as it is sometimes known )
After a few reported cases of CJD , a similar form of the disease found in humans , it is now thought that 'mad-cow disease ' ( BSE ) is the cause
Researchers believe that eating beef containing offal can transmit a fatal disease to humans
This claim has devastated the British beef industry as people are now too scared to eat beef in case they contract the illness
Already , the sales of beef in America have dropped by about 15 % , and in Britain they have dropped by between 6 % and 7 %
Although scientists say that to contract CJD , part of a cow 's offal must be contained in the beef
Customers are still reluctant to eat the meat , in case it has come from some `` dodgy '' butcher trying to cut costs
As you can imagine , this has had a tremendous influence on sales in places such as fast food restaurants where beefburgers are the main item on the menu
An example of one is McDonald 's , where they have issued a notice stating that their beefburgers are made from 100 % of the finest pure beef and do not contain any offal
In my view , no decent restaurant with a good reputation would risk buying poor beef
An outcome like this would mean they would be sued for several thousand pounds and would probably have to sell up
As a result of lower beef demand in areas where beef is produced , there would be a lower need for beef cows
This means that there would be an excess of beef ( or a beef mountain ) that could not be sold
The prices of beef would have to decrease to attract more customers
So , as a result of the claim that beef containing contaminated offal may cause CJD in humans , beef farmers are losing out because they have to sell their meat at a lower price due to low demand
As a result , they may have to diversify towards other areas , such as crops and milking cows , or they may need to explore alternative options , including seeking a government subsidy
I felt that the evidence that BSE causes CJD was not strong enough before the claims were made public
It has therefore caused an unnecessary , deleterious effect on the agricultural industry and the beef market
The question of compensation for services rendered is not as simple as paying a predetermined salary based on qualifications and dedication to the task at hand
If you have preconceived notions about your salary , you will certainly be disappointed , since some employers are sure to value your skills and abilities less than others
Contribution to society is subjective and therefore impossible to compensate equally
In the 1920s in America , it became very popular to disdain people who did not actually work for a living , but merely lived off the interest on their investments
The stock market was experiencing a boom , and several formerly working-class citizens became wealthy and relished the idea of retiring early
But several great authors of that period questioned the right of these investors to live as parasites , as they received money but contributed nearly nothing to society
People who inherit money or live off the interest of investors often seem to spend their time in search of a new thrill , some sort of excitement that money can not buy
Having almost unlimited wealth changes people , whether they are born into it or earn their own money at a young age
But do they have the right to live this way ?
What about people who work very hard , yet they seem to be paid very little ?
A migrant worker may slave away in a field all day long and make less money in a day than a wealthy person spends on a tip at lunch
The answer to this question lies in one 's feelings about Democracy
Some would argue that if a person is smart enough or lucky enough to earn money for an early retirement ( or for their children 's inheritance ) , they are entitled to it
A rather harsh view would be that if someone who works on a menial or physically taxing job does not make a fair or moderate salary , then it is their own fault , or perhaps just bad luck
These opinions are based on a rather faulty American premise that all people are given an equal chance in life and what they make of it is their own responsibility
Apparently , most people believe that they are underpaid and that others are overpaid
For instance , everyone seems to think that doctors make too much money for the work they do , yet none of the doctors are lowering their fees ( they must think that it 's a fair price )
So , unless we wish to impose on the personal lives of wealthy people by making them work harder , or to give money to people who are not wealthy when society does not believe they deserve it , we can not give pay equal to the contribution to society
I agree that in the past , women have had problems with society 's role expectations of them in the workplace and at home
Women have been looked down on if they try to get ahead , and the pay for the same job has differed between a man and a woman
The days when women were required to stay at home are gone
Now , a lot of women work , and those who want to stay at home do so because they want to
A lot of the change in women 's roles is due to the feminists
These are groups of people who have defended women over the years
These people have shown the modern world what women in the workplace can do
The problem is that these feminists have not considered the perspectives of all women
Some women were happy with old traditions
What happens is that all women have to go along with these feminist rules
This makes it hard , because if they do n't , they are looked down upon by their peers
An example is women in the military wanting to serve in combat positions during wartime
Feminists argued about this issue a lot when the Iraq War was going on
They felt that women should have been given the chance to fight
I felt that these people were crazy
Women just ca n't fight in a war very well
They are not strong enough , and if captured , could be raped
They feel that it is not fair that men are the only ones in power
Other women , though , are glad that the rule in the United States stands as it does
Feminists have talked about promotions in the workplace as unfair
Sexual harassment is also involved in a lot of lawsuits
Many women believe they are victims of circumstance
I agree that five to ten years ago this might have been true , but now many employers are the victims
They are scared of what a woman can do ; sometimes , women are viewed differently
There are some things that women can do better than men , and there are some things that men can do better than women
God would have created us all the same if this had not been true
Feminists are trying to make everyone equal ; however , this is impossible to achieve because certain aspects of human nature and societal structures can not be changed
More and more office jobs are being filled by women , but a lot of the physical jobs are still filled by men
I think that traditional roles were a good thing , but modernization has changed everyone 's habits
Divorce is at fifty percent and rising
Modernization is good , but I think women should not be pressured into it if it 's not their choice
There will be a woman as president , and more women will be running companies
Women should be treated equal , but they can only do what nature intends them to do
Whenever a movement begins , whether it be political , religious , or artistic , stereotypes are quick to form
People normally associated with politics , religion , or art are quickly lumped into categories regardless of individual differences
This tragedy is worsened by the tendency of those outside the movement to remember the radical aspects while ignoring the common or ordinary ones
This is especially true of the Women 's Liberation Movement in America
Since its beginnings in the late nineteenth century , Women 's Liberation has been met with adamant and often obstinate opposition
Some of the first radicals , Susan B
At the same time , other feminists , such as Emily Dickinson , were virtually ignored during their lifetime and only acknowledged posthumously as part of the movement
The ignorance of the general public regarding less aggressive feminists made it seem as though the feminist movement was headed only by wild , disgruntled zealots , and this perception was therefore detrimental to the good of society
Although radicals , such as Sands and Anthony , seem docile and backward by modern standards , the problem still exists
From the very beginning , the Women 's Movement in America has been fighting a losing battle
However , I contend that the fault does not lie with the radical members of the movement , but rather with the perception of those observing the movement
When Women 's Lib really took off again in the late 1960s , it was once again destined for failure
Immediately , the focus was on radicals like Stein , instead of the housewife who returned to college and made a career for herself
Those outside the movement could only see the differences between normality and Women 's Liberation
This is still true twenty-five years later
Women supporting equal pay for women and other liberal causes , like affirmative action , are only seen in the shadow of the bra-burning , anti-shaving leaders of the 1970s
The goodness of their cause is undermined by the public 's perception of the radicals
So , what am I getting at ?
Only so-called feminists have not , in themselves , harmed the women 's movement
However , the popular perception of them has changed over time
For so many years , the good that feminists have promoted for women has fallen by the wayside in favor of other , more radical ideas
Like many other aspects and movements in life , they would be more readily received if the public at which they were aimed was not so jaded
Within this century , there have been many technological advances which have resulted in a drastically different society than that of a hundred years ago
Clearly , of this century 's inventions , the one that has made the most impact on worldwide views and lifestyles is the television
This instrument has brought other worlds right into the living room , making it possible to see life in other countries in a way that was never before possible
However , the invention of television also gave society an easy way to waste time ; one has only to turn it on to tune out reality
Television has the potential to offer wonderful things to its viewers , such as educational programming for children , cultural programs about far-away places , and a closer look at current events that can not be given by a newspaper
Television has the power to bring war into the home , as well as artistic expressions of those involved in the program production , giving society the opportunity to understand their own culture more fully
However , this is not the way in which television has influenced society
On the contrary , television has become the escape route of the masses , a way for people to flee from the conflicts they experience in their culture , rather than confront them and try to understand them
In the minds of most Americans , television is regarded as a diversion rather than an educational tool , as free entertainment instead of a source of easily accessible knowledge
Millions of Americans can be found staring at the TV at any given time , watching sitcoms , soap operas , and cartoons
The T
Television is a major cause of the lack of togetherness found in many American families and has also resulted in an increase in laziness
The more time one spends watching TV , the less motivated one becomes ; there is no need to seek worthwhile activities when it is much easier to sit on the couch , pick up the remote control , and stare at a box
Television , therefore , has changed society in ways that could hardly have been dreamed of 100 years ago
`` It has given society another creative outlet , providing insights into worlds that could be seen in no other way , and an opportunity for society to better educate itself
However , throughout the years , television has lost much of its integrity ; the programs offered are usually cheap entertainment rather than education
The entertainment aspect of television has offered society an easy escape from its problems and difficulties
Therefore , since the invention of television , society has become more informed but so lazy that it no longer thinks about this new information , and has distanced itself from family life
A discovery that has significantly changed many people 's lives and their ways of thinking is the AIDS epidemic known as AIDS
Though it has probably been around for a while , its presence has n't really been known until fairly recently , and its consequences have been devastating
AIDS has definitely had an impact on people in the United States and across the world , because it always leads to death and there is no cure
It has caused a lot of prejudice and paranoia among people , tearing them apart
For example , there is more stigma attached to being a homosexual male , not only because of their sexual orientation , but also due to various societal misconceptions
This kind of ignorant thinking is breaking us apart
Also , when Ryan White , a boy who had contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion , was diagnosed , the townspeople and his school treated him like an outcast and would n't allow him to attend school
With new discoveries of AIDS , paranoia is at an all-time high
Doctors are discovering that some strains of HIV are undetectable
This has really scared people , because they may have AIDS and not even know it
I feel this has really made people think about their actions
In the early 1980s , casual sex in the United States was a widely accepted idea ; now , however , people rarely consider it
Relationships seemed to be valued more than one-night stands
People are starting to realize that they really do have to be careful , and with more education on this disease , I 'm sure more changes will come about
The twentieth century has seen more wars than any other previous period of time
Due to advances in communication , transportation , and information sharing , the world has rapidly shrunk as a body of people living in close proximity
In the second of the World Wars , the race was on to create the most devastating , most powerful , and most frightening weapon the world had ever known
In my opinion , the discovery and harnessing of atomic energy , and the corresponding invention of nuclear weapons , have been the most significant factors of change in our lifetime , if not , perhaps , in several lifetimes , or even more accurately , over the course of several lifetimes
As missile technology and nuclear fusion capacities increased and improved , fear began to replace nationalism , and our small world began to erect barriers between its members
From my experience , as an American , I can remember associating communism with the nuclear threat , Soviet citizens with the anti-Christ , and bomb shelters , secret underground cities , and weapons orbiting our planet , with these being part of daily , normal life
Perhaps this increasingly common mentality is the worst effect of our cold-war , nuclear age
On a planet which desperately needs our focus on environmental and humanitarian issues , my country has spent countless trillions of dollars on nuclear weapons , including testing , improvement , and implementation
As a commonplace goal and a testimonial landmark to nine presidential administrations , the Cold War has manifested its awesome power and control over nearly every facet of Americana , from survival kits and basement bomb shelters to a constantly circulating chief Executive command post in the air
In just the past three years , our family of nations has seen the dismantling of the Berlin Wall and hundreds of other smaller symbols of freedom , and an end to oppression in numerous cases
With the advancement of global unity and the dismantling of physical and psychological divisions , the walls , barbed wire , and mental barriers are falling , bringing more change than our planet has seen since its formation
Although the old habits die hard , they are indeed dying
In America , the military has been reduced by several thousand troops , and the production of nuclear warheads has virtually come to a standstill
Hopefully , with continued efforts , nuclear fusion and fission will turn from means of strategy , destruction , and waste to energy production , medicine , and other humanitarian goals
With this thawing of attitudes , our relationships with our neighbors may once again become warm and friendly
The discovery of penicillin as an antibiotic was one of the greatest advances in medicinal chemistry
As a natural antibiotic , penicillin was discovered to have many uses in stopping and preventing the spread of infections
This `` wonder drug '' also led to the discovery of a variety of other naturally occurring antibiotics that could also be cultured `` in vitro '' in a laboratory
The sudden discovery of these useful compounds not only improved the chances of a patient 's survival in a hospital but also created a significant need for medical chemists to study and classify each new drug as it was being discovered
As discoveries of new antibiotics decreased , chemists began to wonder if certain variations of these drugs could be synthesized and used as medicine as well
It was also attempted to increase the production of the naturally occurring antibiotics through synthesis
Both of these new attempts necessitated further research , involving more companies and additional medical chemists , which in turn led to a tremendous increase in the industry
It was discovered that the older drugs could be synthesized efficiently while still remaining biologically active
New drugs were also synthesized , some of which were found to be medically useful while others were not
A variety of new drugs continually appeared on the market , and changed the way people thought about taking medicine
It was now much easier to obtain antibiotics for simple illnesses such as the common cold
Huge enterprises , such as Upjohn , were formed and grew , and universities had research teams devoted to producing efficient synthesis routes for the production of all kinds of antibiotics
The discovery of one compound led to an improvement in the health of millions of people , the discovery of more antibiotics , and the growth of a booming industry comprising research teams and large companies
The synthesis of antibiotics and research of their uses still continues today as thousands of universities and companies around the world continue the work of a small bacterium -- the producer of penicillin
The modern microcomputer has evolved at an incredibly fast pace—from the very first modern computers in the 1940s to the computers of today—there have been many technological advances , which have had a tremendous impact on society
The computer has eliminated many jobs through automation of factories : accounting , engineering , and other scientific fields
The effects of the computer have been tremendous
The computer has made life easier from a physical standpoint and harder from a mental standpoint
The physical effects of the computer are numerous and can be easily seen
In offices , the computer is everywhere
From word processors to spreadsheet and database programs , computers have made office work easier and faster
Automation of factories has also eliminated many manual jobs
Almost everyone has at least one simple computer , e
There are , of course , many other things computers are used for , but a lengthy list is not necessary , as everyone in developed countries already knows how abundant computers are ; however , it 's worth noting that people in developing countries may not have the same level of access
The mental effects of computers are two-fold
Firstly , computers have made mathematical computations easy , but as a result , many people do not fully understand how or why their computers perform calculations
This has created a surplus of needless computations , figures , etc
People can easily do calculus or other types of functions with a computer
What many people do not realize is that computers make errors all the time
Granted , it is the person who told the computer what to do that truly made the error ; however , if that person knew what he should do , or in other words , could use a computer , he would not get erroneous answers
Mathematical models , theories , etc
Are absolutely riddled with errors simply because there are many things people do n't know or ca n't predict
Due to these errors , they frequently exist in the world of computers , simply because humans are ignorant , for whatever reason , of many variables
Secondly , computers have sometimes become more reliable than people
A computer 's circuits do n't get tired , and , if programmed 100 % correctly ( or another impossible computation ) , never make errors
The supposed reliability of these systems has left many workers unemployed
The effects of this are unpredictable
Anger , frustration , fear , and many other negative emotions have emerged alongside the rise of computer usage
Clearly , there is evidence of good and bad results from the advent of modern computers
It would be practically impossible to throw the computer away or never use it again
Yet , there are practical solutions
Better mathematical education is needed for everyone who uses a computer , other than a simple calculator
Also , limiting some theoretical programming could eliminate alarming predictions or erroneous results
The key is probably in the classroom
People should learn more about the ramifications of what they are doing
Understanding this concept probably requires knowledge of philosophy , psychology , mathematics , and science
In either case , whether computers are good or bad , there 's no denying their impact on people 's lives
A large egg , sometimes as large as a small car , with a metal arrow at its center , has changed the size of the world and communication among the countries within it
The satellite dish , created in recent years , has revolutionized telecommunications
In part , it has created the Information Age , which is often labelled as the latter part of the 20th century
Although the date of its invention is not certain , it must be recognized as one of the most vital tools used in society today , among world leaders , trading companies , the media , and the entertainment world
Ted Turner revolutionized the use of the satellite , with his creation of CNN , the round-the-clock , round-the-world news station
Presidents and dictators alike switch channels to receive firsthand information , such as impeachments , coups d'etat , or civil wars , from news networks
Decisions of governmental autonomy are being made based on that night 's news by a CNN commentator
The leaders and presidents of enterprises such as Panasonic and Core refer to CNN , which they access via satellite dish , on a daily basis
Stocks are an integral part of their livelihood
The entertainment world has taken full advantage of the satellite dish , characterizing the Information Age as the MTV age
The creation of MTV in 1980 has dramatically changed the entertainment business
The money poured into creating videos , and the profits from viewership have had a strong effect on the world economy
40 % of U
The satellite dish has also created distinct advantages for cable TV , as well as for naval programs
The intelligence of an average teenager is being lowered as a result of excessive cable viewing , which is made possible by satellite dishes
Naval programs have wasted excessive amounts of money in the United States on satellite dishes
And one must not forget space programs such as Star Wars
The creation of the satellite dish in the past 20 years has altered human intelligence for better or for worse
The advent of the digital revolution has created an information age , which , while bringing many benefits , also poses significant dangers
The pros and cons of the satellite dish are numerous
The only observation that can be made is that it has altered people 's lives significantly
It is up to the average person to decide if this alteration will be for the better , or worse
The discovery of atomic energy is undoubtedly the most awesome as well as terrible invention not only of the 20th century but of all time
In 1945 , J
The reason behind the fear that this energy causes is rooted in its incredible power to destroy things
Never before had the world seen something with such a capacity to kill !
Never before had one object of such small size been able to take so many lives !
For this reason , it is considered the most awe-inspiring and dangerous weapon in the world
Unfortunately , with each passing day , the world 's need for this dangerous energy increases
Not only does it have the capacity to kill
`` but also the capability to supply and energize the world
One drawback of this decision is the danger it poses
In utilizing this power in plants and factories , we run the risk of contaminating the land , damaging the ozone layer , rendering the seas useless , and killing our own species as well as many others on earth
Although we have many other alternative power sources , we still use this dangerous invention
It is illogical to think that with continued nuclear use , we can escape harm
As a result of pollution and other factors , we have holes in our ozone layer and problems with our soil in numerous parts of the world
It would be logical to think that the leaders of the world would confer and aspire to put a stop to nuclear use in an effort to avoid any further damage to the Earth and its inhabitants
The saddest part of this tragedy is that there have been very few efforts to do so
The lack of vision from our leaders is almost appalling
With the lack of respect for the planet being the general attitude of today , what is to become of our children ?
The current situation of the world 's environment is a sad one
It is , however , a problem of which nuclear energy is only a small piece
Unfortunately , the day will soon come when the damage caused by this apathy will be irreversible
This is why it is imperative to act today
It starts with you
Write to your local congressman
An invention of the 20th century that has significantly changed people 's lives is the airplane
The extent to which this invention has altered people 's lives is astronomical
The airplane opened up new avenues for travel and also broadened people 's perceptions of the entire world
It also introduced what seemed to be a completely impossible concept , the concept of flying , that no human can do without a machine
Before the invention of the airplane , long-distance traveling was a very difficult , time-consuming task
For this reason , people did not travel very long distances and missed the opportunity of visiting countries with cultures very different from their own
One could travel by boat , but this was inconvenient and often dangerous because of various things , such as disease , hunger , and threatening weather ; as noted above , it was also extremely time-consuming
Because of the lack of long-distance travel , people often had a very ethnocentric and limited concept of the world
I have learned a lot about my own culture just from being in Spain , and that is the only foreign country I have ever visited
I can admit that , before I came to Spain , I was very ignorant about other cultures
Even though I would watch the news and read about other cultures , I still did not have the opportunity to witness it firsthand
The invention of the airplane has opened many doors , including that to international relations
Since the invention of the airplane , the world has seen an increase in close contact between political systems and international business endeavors
The frequency at which foreign countries are able to communicate and negotiate face to face has drastically improved the establishment of international trade
The airplane has also sped up the whole postal communication system
Life with airplanes is more faster-paced
Cars , telephones , and nuclear energy are just three examples of inventions and discoveries that have had profound effects on modern-day life
We must remember , however , that the field of technology is not the only one in which significant advances have been made in the 20th century
Another discovery of this past century has been feminism , which has had a significant impact on the lives of both men and women
Of course , the issue of feminism is not a new one , but only in the past century has much progress been made toward gender equality , with the important exception of women winning the right to vote in the 1800s
As recently as the 1950s , it was still both typical and ideal to have the woman in the home , doing housekeeping and tending to the children
The first significant equal rights movement in the U
Even today , the woman still earns only about 60 cents for every dollar that a man earns
Feminism is not just about work and money , but also about the image of women
It is only recently that we have discovered , or rather begun to think about , how much things such as pornography or the language we use help to form the image of women
A recognition of such influences on the image of women is the first step in breaking it down , so that women are seen as they truly are
Feminism is better described as a 'discovery in progress ' ; it is a social movement and an attitude that have not yet become mainstream
Only when women have achieved equality with men , will there be no need for feminism , and the goal will have been achieved
In my opinion , the idea that has changed people 's lives the most in the 20th century is that of protecting the environment
Today , people have become aware of the importance of the environment to our future
People are concerned about nuclear weapons
We realize that countries that have many weapons have the power to destroy the world
Also related to this topic is the issue of nuclear waste
Nuclear waste is not only harmful to humans , it also kills animals and plants
We are now fighting for action to clean up our lakes and rivers
Companies are no longer able to freely dump their waste without being heavily fined
People have also become concerned with nature
We used to assume our natural resources were never-ending
Now , though , we realize that what we use needs to be replaced
For example , deforestation is a very big issue
We also realize our fossil fuels need to be used more conservatively
Another important topic we are all aware of is recycling
This links two issues , one of not producing many non-biodegradable products and the other being the reuse of what we have
Recycling in a small way also helps those without homes because they receive money for their collections
Many countries realize that recycling is not only beneficial to their economy , and it is also beneficial to their environment
Another important issue is that of conserving energy
In the past , once again , we assumed our energy was never-ending
Now , though , people are more inclined to turn off their lights when they are not in their rooms , not to leave taps running , and not to waste our natural resources
We realize that conserving is beneficial to our environment and it also saves money
We have also become more considerate of our animal life
We are no longer able to kill animals without restriction
We do still raise some animals for food , but hunting is limited , and we are all aware of the possibility of extinction
One realizes that animals have rights too
In conclusion , the idea of caring for the environment is still a new one
We are slowly becoming more aware , and are beginning to take more precautions
The ideas above are just a few of the topics we are now concerned with
But we are heading in the right direction , and we are hopeful that by the 21st century , we will have fixed everything that we have destroyed
Computers have definitely affected people 's lives
I have a computer and my life has changed because of it
I am able to store almost all the information I need for school and other things on my computer
This means I 'm able to store more information in an organized fashion
Though I have only used a fraction of my computer 's abilities , I 'm still aware of the tremendous opportunities that I have or will have
Aside from being able to store large amounts of information , I 'm also able to process and edit things quickly
For example , without the use of a computer , I had to balance my checkbook once a month and had to do this with a calculator , a pen , and a piece of paper
Of course , this was very time-consuming and open to error
Also , with the use of the word processor , I am able to edit and rearrange documents without altering the entire document
My father has the same program in his computer and is able to buy online tickets without leaving the house , moreover without picking up the phone
Also , I realize that my experience with computers is limited , and that the power of computers is , to me , incomprehensible
I 'm here now in Madrid
How did I get there ?
Well , I applied to this program , was accepted , and then flew here from the US
But without the use of computers , I would still be struggling with the secretary in the International Programs Office at Boston University , no doubt
Instead , once I applied to the program , the application for which was probably computer-generated , I assume my info was processed by a computer
Without this luxury , the International Programs Office would inevitably be inundated with paperwork , and things would therefore be lost or at least misplaced
When booking my flight , although I did n't do this myself , the transaction would have seemed impossible without the aid of computers
Computers have had the most significant impact on people in the second half of the 20th century
An invention of the 20th century that I think has significantly changed people 's lives is television
TV allows the instantaneous communication of ideas , images , news , etc
Now , if something is happening in any part of the world - from across town all the way to Beijing - every person worldwide can watch the event as it happens
While previously people had to wait days or even weeks for news , which consisted of second- or third-hand accounts that always involved much interpretation and distortion , now they can see it happening for themselves as it happens
Additionally , the fact that so many people , especially in the US , have television sets means that everyone , or at least those who watch , receives the same inflow of information and ideas
So , for example , people in Spain can be informed about how people in California or Japan speak and act ; this allows people from different cultures to come together and discuss ideas
In my opinion , this is one part of the process of making the world a smaller , more unified place , or a `` global village '' as it has been called
Not only is the news , but also entertainment , an important practical function of television , through television entertainment , as well as through literature and drama , people learn different messages about life
They can observe various actions being demonstrated for their benefit and understand the consequences of these actions without having to experience them firsthand
Unfortunately , these TV shows are not always accurate portrayals of real life and have a tendency to glorify violence , as well as portray life in a way that suggests the good guy always wins and always survives dangerous situations
However , this sense of reality is not so distorted and so hidden that people are acting like Superman
As long as one has a well-developed sense of reality , TV can be an excellent tool for understanding the world we live in
The waters of the culinary seas have been calm and consistent for centuries
Progress has moved slow like the tides and the constant rhythm of the waves has shown little change
However , with the dawn of the twentieth century , a storm has emerged
`` With this storm , the waters have churned and spawned a wave that has crashed into every kitchen
This wave is a microwave
Never before has an invention revolutionized an entire field of science in this way
A complete break has been made in the way food is prepared
At the dawn of time , cavemen cooked animal flesh over open fires
As history progressed , spits and barbecues emerged
Technology saw the advent of the wood stove , and later , the ones fueled by coal
Modern times saw gas and electric ranges become a staple
All these things had one thing in common : fire
Flame , the source of life , has always been used to prepare food for mankind throughout history
However , the microwave uses radiation to excite water particles in food , thus creating friction , which in turn creates heat
`` This is a prime example of thinking that breaks with tradition , breaks away from convention , and forges new paths
If this were not amazing enough , the microwave cuts cooking time in half
If you had told someone 100 years ago that you could cut cooking time in half , and not use fire , they would have thought you crazy , or bewitched , or under the influence of heavy drugs
In an age where time is the scarcest commodity , our society has embraced solutions that eliminate wasted hours in the kitchen
A mother who works can come home and whip up something in minutes in the microwave , whereas before , she would spend a lot of time slaving in the kitchen
The microwave is excellent for reheating , making it easier for people to make extra food to eat later
Time is conserved again
As I have said before , there is no fire !
This marvel of technology has helped propel people into the dizzying pace of life that most of us lead
Throughout history , one can see that the great revelations in all areas come from breaks in tradition , new insights , and different perspectives
All these components were needed to create the microwave , which is essential nowadays
Eating is something that everyone must do
This device sped up one of our most important activities and thus revolutionized life in the fast-paced 20th century
When I was in the tenth grade , a teacher said that the two most important inventions that made the idea of a totalitarian government possible were the machine gun and the radio
A machine gun can be used to keep public order , or to enforce Martial Law
The radio can be used to communicate ideas , or , under a dictatorship , for propaganda
The machine gun has not changed many lives in the 20th century , except for those it has killed
The idea behind the radio is simple
There is one transmitter , and it sends its signals through the air waves , with the potential to reach millions of receivers
In the 20th century , radio became a source of information and entertainment
The radio keeps people informed
I do n't think any people of my generation can even begin to comprehend how our lives would be different
Every morning I listen to the weather forecast and dress accordingly
At night , one can sit by the radio and hear how the events of the day unfolded
Radio , hence , gives people the option of becoming passive observers rather than active participants in the news-making process
Newspapers had been around for many years , but it was not until the invention of radio that the true power of the media became fully apparent
Radio enables reaching many more people instantly
As a form of entertainment , radio and its most important and now more common offshoot , television have changed people 's lives
A typical day for a child in today 's world consists of going to school and coming home to watch TV
There have even been forms of entertainment created , such as videogames , for this purpose
Nowadays everybody watches TV
My Señora , for example , is over 100 years old , and for her , TV is the greatest thing in the world
She sits in front of the television all day , and it keeps her happy
Television offers soap operas , game shows , sitcoms , sporting events , movies and much more to keep us entertained 24 hours a day
In short , I do n't know what life was like before radio , but its invention has changed the way we see and do things
A current ideology in the United States today is that to be successful , one must follow many of the written and unwritten rules of society
Everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed , and if they do not take advantage of it , they will fail
One can see these ideas in popular media every day
TV commercials and TV programs project models of how one should behave
In the 20th century , the values on which the United States was founded have changed in meaning and application in modern-day America
Today , since the invention and utilization of modern technologies such as computers , life for Americans moves at a much faster pace
People are more mobile , can work more , and buy more things , but time for relaxation and family is often substituted with TV
With everyone moving at such a fast pace , it is easy to miss the gaps , and the voices of the mass media can easily replace those voices that struggle to be heard
The parts of the new machine need to be oiled and regulated
When Voltaire wrote Candide , a literary style known as Neoclassicism was at its peak
There was a group of scholars in France , l'Académie française , which set guidelines for French literature
According to l'Académie Française , all literature of the Neoclassic period must follow the rules of propriety , which required authors to avoid certain topics , including issues of sex , violence , the church , and the state
Another standard upheld by the Academy is the idea of verisimilitude , making literature as realistic as possible by keeping time , setting , and plot true to life
Voltaire , as a Neoclassicist , knew all these regulations and followed them in his literature
However , when writing Candide , Voltaire defied the Académie 's rules
Candide is a parody of the guidelines of Neoclassicism
Neoclassicists believed that literature should have good manners ; they did not want to offend anyone by discussing sensitive topics such as sex , violence , church , or state issues
In Candide , Voltaire did not seem to mind stepping on toes - in fact , he did not mind smashing feet !
Voltaire went beyond many people 's comfort level when he openly discussed sexual topics
He told the story of the two girls from Orellion , who were known for their love of monkeys
The situation turned violent when Cunegonde was being raped by a barber , and she witnessed the barber 's murder as the barber was assaulting her
The wise old woman was subjected to the removal of a buttock by pirates ; she also suffered a horrific experience of rape
After the Baron is caught bathing with the Muslim , he receives 100 lashes as punishment for his sin
Candide stabs the Baron , a Jesuit priest , after the Baron forbids Candide 's marriage to Cunegonde
Ironically , although Voltaire mentions many acts of violence , each act is treated with a sense of detachment
The lighthearted way Voltaire portrays acts of sex and violence in Candide demonstrates the parody form in which he writes
Voltaire chooses to address issues of the church and state
He attracts the hypocrisy of the Church , given that the old woman 's father is the Pope
When Candide visits the land of Eldorado , Voltaire shows that the people have a perfect relationship with God ; they praise God only because there is nothing they want from Him
Voltaire uses the perfect relationship with God , as depicted in an unrealistic situation , to highlight the imperfections in society 's relationship with God in the real world
Voltaire makes fun of the aristocracy in his description of the Baron , who came from 71 generations of nobility but still lacks gentleness
Candide and his companions dine with six dethroned kings who represent the overemphasis society places on social hierarchy
In his portrayal of the utopian society of Eldorado , Voltaire exposes the imperfections of our society
According to Lunde , 35 % of homicide victims are killed by someone they know
Statistics from 1956 are greater than Lundes ' thesis
Frustration is the main factor most implicated in these tragedies
Most cases are those of pulling the trigger
Today , racial prejudice still exists , but less action has been taken than there was 30 years ago
Thirty years ago , minorities could n't ride a bus , vote , or go to school with white people
Desegregation reduced some prejudice ; however , it still exists
The difference today is that social prejudice is not openly expressed as it was 30 years ago
I would advise the client to be extremely nice to that person and do favors for them
That person would then feel obligated to do nice things back , and return favors
This is based on equity theory
It would be better for the client to do nice things for the person than to ask a favor of the person
Someone who lives in the north who comes to live in the south may not be prejudiced toward Black people at first
After living in the south for a while , they may adopt southern attitudes toward Blacks and feel prejudiced toward them
This behavior is an example of conformity
The same challenges and experiences go for Southerners who move north
They come to feel prejudiced toward Jews
I know someone who has lived all over the world
He is prejudiced toward Jews , Blacks , and Mexicans
He adopted certain attitudes against minorities in the different regions he has lived in , or alternatively for a past action : He adopted certain attitudes against minorities in the different regions he lived in
Our country has been coined ' a melting pot ' , implying that we all come from different backgrounds but have joined or melted together to form a diverse American society
But a person 's heritage , as we are realizing , is important to their sense of self and community
Ethnic American cultures have been reviving and trying to reestablish roots that were once lost in the process of becoming model U
The differences that they are rediscovering only add more color , flavor , and excitement to that brewing `` pot '' of our people
However , some individuals and even groups of Americans are reacting negatively to this ethnic explosion , seen most clearly through the arts
They do n't want to accept these differences
They choose to remain indifferent to the plights of their fellow Americans
As Elie Wiesel , author of such books as Night , says about indifference , it is the opposite of everything good
The opposite of love , beauty , intelligence , light , joy , life , and growth is not their familiar antonym , but rather indifference
Ethnic American literature tries to combat this indifference by vividly and uniquely expressing certain aspects of different American cultures
The gamut of ethnic American literature is without bounds
Each group has its own peculiarities and attributes that make its writing unique
In many cases , the words used in ethnic American literature reflect a knowledge of a different `` mother tongue ''
For instance , Native American poetry is more expressive and visual partly because their language is deeply rooted in the observation of the natural environment
Chinese American Literature is philosophical and literal because its native language has these characteristics
African American literature is often melodious and rhythmic , mirroring its similar achievements in the Jazz and Blues music
All these examples ( and more ) give us some insight into other cultures that we would otherwise never know
The stories told in this genre of literature , however , are likely the most important aspect of Ethnic American literature
It is through the experiences of the characters that we learn about the different cultures in the United States
When we learn of the trials and hardships that they went through , we can sympathize with their emotions and try to accept that diversity
The stories of black American slaves and of concentration camp victims are necessary to avoid indifference
Without learning about the past and present horrors , there is no way to ensure the future of humanity
Ethnic American literature benefits the U
It opens our eyes to the reality of the suffering of others
It gives us a fresh perspective on the world around us
Self-reflection helps us to understand our personal relationships better
Most of all , it gives us more common ground on which to live , and grow and prosper
Hopefully , we will someday fulfill Elie Wiesel 's goal and put an end to indifference ; this literature is a step in the right direction towards promoting acceptance and celebrating the diversity of our country
Being different is beautiful
Violence on television can be seen on many channels offered by cable
With an average national TV viewing time of 7 1/4 hours daily , the prevalence of violence in broadcasts is a serious concern
Television programming in the United States is considered the most violent in advanced industrialized nations ( Hepburn 1 )
Many children watch violent TV shows because the action thrills them , and this can sometimes cause the child to become violent
Violence is common in TV entertainment : the dramas that portray stories about crime , psychotic murderers , police cases , emergency services , international terrorism , and war ( Hepburn 1 )
Television violence is prevalent in the United States , but some people disagree about its negative impact on children
The V-chip is an electrical device that blocks out violent television shows
Some people , such as the Senate Commerce Committee , are not satisfied with it
The Senate Commerce Committee approved bills creating a partial ban on TV violence and a so-called report card that would identify stations carrying violent programming and the advertisers sponsoring it
The bills would apply to broadcasting and cable , as noted by Stern ( 1 )
Some of the proposals to anti-violence are as follows : the Senate V-chip , the House V-chip , a Technology Fund , a Violent Crime Safe Harbor , and a Violence Report Card
These proposals could work if Congress had some support
The National Association of Broadcasters accused the Senate of `` piling on a stream of proposals to build up an unprecedented federal censorship bureaucracy ''
The NAB also insisted that broadcasters already responded to concerns over violence on television ( Stern 1 )
Some television shows depict violence because violence appeals to adult viewers
If a certain plot involves a murder , then the murder must happen
Some people may not want the actual murder to be shown , however , that decision is up to whoever is writing the television show
Many movies made for television say that they may contain violent scenes and that viewer discretion is advised , but how many parents actually watch television with their teenagers ?
An exhaustive examination of the broadcast networks ' programming during the 1995–1995 season has concluded that sinister combat violence pervades a significant number of Saturday-morning cartoons ( Jensen 1 )
How much violence is there ?
The most violent cartoons are `` Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles '' , `` Spider-Man '' , and some episodes of `` Bugs Bunny '' that feature Elmer Fudd
As for shows containing sinister combat violence , that is strictly up to the viewer to decide
The cause of television violence is to add texture to the show , but not to poison children 's minds
The infamous V-chip may stop some shows from being shown to children , but one day , that child will see violence and they will have to deal with it , either rationally or not
