            "rationale":"The word (Campany 2005:16) should be deleted because it is a citation that interrupts the flow of the sentence and does not contribute to the sentence’s cohesion. Removing it enhances the readability and coherence of the statement."

            "rationale":"The word consistently should be replaced by previously because the sentence is referring to findings that occurred in the past, not necessarily findings that happened regularly or without exception.\nThe word extensive should be deleted because it adds unnecessary emphasis without contributing meaningfully to the clarity or relevance of the sentence."
