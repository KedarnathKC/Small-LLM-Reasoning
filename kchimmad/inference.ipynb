      "Here your job is to answer a math question. Your question will appear after 8 demonstrations of similar math tasks. As in those demonstrations, you must generate both a step-by-step reasoning and a final answer. Perform a simple action, e.g., a single mathematical operation, at each step of your reasoning. Your final answer must contain only a number and no additional text. State your final answer after ####. Q: Bobby wanted pancakes for breakfast.  The recipe on the box makes 21 pancakes.  While he ate 5 pancakes, his dog jumped up and was able to eat 7 before being caught.  How many pancakes does Bobby have left?\n",
      "A: Bobby ate 5 pancakes and his dog ate 7 so 5+7 = <<5+7=12>>12\n",
      "The recipe makes 21 pancakes and 12 were eaten so 21-12 = <<21-12=9>>9 pancakes were left\n",

The pieces of candies come from blocks of candy, which each produce 30 pieces of candy. If Jan breaks down 3 blocks of candy and every single piece of candy from this is used in the candy necklaces, how many friends receive a candy necklace?\n",
